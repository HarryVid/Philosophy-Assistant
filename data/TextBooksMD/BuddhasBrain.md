# Foreword

_Buddha’s Brain_ is an invitation to use the focus of your mind to harness the
power of attention to enhance your life and your relationships with others.
Synthesizing ancient insights from contemplative practice in the Buddhist
traditions with modern discoveries from the field of neuroscience, Drs. Rick
Hanson and Richard Mendius have assembled a thought-provoking and
practical guide that walks you step-by-step through awakening your mind.

A revolution in science has recently revealed that the adult brain remains

open to change throughout the lifespan. Though many brain scientists have
in the past stated that the mind is just the activity of the brain, we now can
look at the connection between these two dimensions of our lives from a
different perspective. When we consider the mind as an embodied and
relational process that regulates the flow of energy and information, we
come to realize that we can actually use the mind to change the brain. The
simple truth is that how we focus our attention, how we intentionally direct
the flow of energy and information through our neural circuits, can directly
alter the brain’s activity and its structure. The key is to know the steps
toward using our awareness in ways that promote well-being.

Knowing that the mind is relational and that the brain is the social organ

of the body, we also come to another new point of view: Our relationships
with one another are not a casual part of our lives; they are fundamental to
how our minds function and are an essential aspect of brain health. Our
social connections with one another shape our neural connections that form
the structure of the brain. This means that the way we communicate alters
the very circuitry of our brain, especially in ways that help keep our lives in
balance. Science further verifies that when we cultivate compassion and
mindful awareness in our lives—when we let go of judgments and attend
fully to the present—we are harnessing the social circuits of the brain to
enable us to transform even our relationship with our own self.

The authors have woven together Buddhist practices developed over two

thousand years and new insights into the workings of the brain to offer us
this guide to intentionally creating these positive changes in ourselves.
Modern times often cause us to go on automatic pilot, continually
multitasking and busying our lives with digital stimulation, information


-----

overload, and schedules that stress our brains and overwhelm our lives.
Finding time to pause amidst this chaos has become an urgent need few of
us take the time to satisfy. With _Buddha’s Brain,_ we are invited to take a
deep breath and consider the neural reasons why we should slow ourselves
down, balance our brain, and improve our connections with one another,
and with our self.

The exercises offered here are based on practices that have been

scientifically demonstrated to have positive effects in shaping our internal
world by making us more focused, resilient, and resourceful. These wellestablished steps also enhance our empathy for others, widening our circles
of compassion and care into the interconnected world in which we live. The
promise of harnessing our minds to change our brains through these
practices is to build the circuits of kindness and well-being moment by
moment, one person, one relationship at a time. What more can we ask for?
And what better time to begin than now?

# Preface

In _Buddha’s Brain,_ Drs. Rick Hanson and Richard Mendius offer you a
beautifully clear and practical connection to the essential wisdom teachings
of the Buddha. Using the contemporary language of scientific research, they
invite the reader to open to the mysteries of the mind, bringing a modern
understanding to the ancient and profound teachings of inner meditation
practice. _Buddha’s Brain_ skillfully weaves these classical teachings with the
revolutionary findings of neuroscience, which has begun to confirm the
human capacities for mindfulness, compassion, and self-regulation that are
central to contemplative training.

In reading this book, you will learn both brain science and practical inner

ways to enhance well-being, develop ease and compassion, and reduce
suffering. You will be introduced to wise new perspectives on life and the
biological bases for fostering the development of this wisdom. These
chapters will help you better understand the workings of the mind and the
neurological roots of happiness, empathy, and interdependence.

The teachings that underlie each chapter—the noble truths, the

foundations of mindfulness, and the development of virtue, lovingkindness,
forgiveness, and inner peace—are straightforward and immediate, presented
with the Buddha’s openhanded invitation for each person to understand
individually. The practices that follow these teachings are equally clear and
authentic. They offer fundamentally the same trainings you would receive
in a meditation temple.

I have seen Rick and Richard offer these teachings, and I respect how

positively it affects the minds and hearts of those who come to practice with
them.

More than ever, the human world needs to find ways to build love,

understanding, and peace, individually and on a global scale.

May these words contribute to this critical endeavor.

Blessings,

Jack Kornfield, Ph.D.

# Introduction

This book is about how to reach inside your own brain to create more
happiness, love, and wisdom. It explores the historically unprecedented
intersection of psychology, neurology, and contemplative practice to answer
two questions:

What brain states underlie the mental states of happiness, love, and
wisdom?
How can you use your mind to stimulate and strengthen these
positive brain states?

The result is a practical guide to your brain, full of tools you can use to

gradually change it for the better.

Richard is a neurologist and I’m a neuropsychologist. While I’ve written

most of the words here, Richard has been my long-time collaborator and
teaching partner; his insights into the brain from his thirty years as a
physician are woven into these pages. Together we’ve founded the
Wellspring Institute for Neuroscience and Contemplative Wisdom; its
website, [www.wisebrain.org](http://www.wisebrain.org/) , offers many articles, talks, and other
resources.

In this book you’ll learn effective ways to deal with difficult states of

mind, including stress, low mood, distractibility, relationship issues,
anxiety, sorrow, and anger. But our main focus will be on positive wellbeing, psychological growth, and spiritual practice. For thousands of years,
contemplatives—the Olympic athletes of mental training—have studied the
mind. In this book we’ll take the contemplative tradition we know best—
Buddhism—and apply it to the brain to reveal neural pathways to
happiness, love, and wisdom. No one knows the full nature of the brain of a
Buddha or of any other person. But what is increasingly known is how to
stimulate and strengthen the neural foundations of joyful, caring, and
deeply insightful states of mind.

## How to Use This Book


-----

You don’t need any background in neuroscience, psychology, or meditation
to use this book. It weaves together information and methods—like an
operating manual for your brain combined with a toolbox—and you’ll find
the tools that work best for you.

Because the brain is fascinating, we’ve presented a good deal of the latest

science about it, including numerous references in case you want to look up
these studies yourself. (But to avoid this turning into a textbook, we’ve
simplified the descriptions of neural activities to focus on their essential
features.) On the other hand, if you’re more interested in practical methods,
it’s fine to glide over the science parts. Of course, psychology and
neurology are both such young sciences that there’s a lot they don’t
understand yet. So we haven’t attempted to be comprehensive. In fact,
we’ve been opportunistic, focusing on methods that have a plausible
scientific explanation for how they light up your neural networks of
contentment, kindness, and peace.

These methods include some guided meditations. The instructions for

these are deliberately loose, often including language that’s poetic and
evocative rather than narrow and specific. You can approach these in
different ways: you might just read and think about them; you might bring
parts of them into any meditative practices you are already doing; you
might work through them with a friend; or you might record the instructions
and do them by yourself. The instructions are just suggestions; pause as
long as you like between them. There is no wrong way to do a meditation—
the right way is what feels right to you.

A word of caution: This book isn’t a substitute for professional care, and

it is not a treatment for any mental or physical condition. Different things
work for different people. Sometimes a method may stir up uncomfortable
feelings, especially if you have a history of trauma. Feel free to ignore a
method, discuss it with a friend (or counselor), change it, or drop it. Be kind
to yourself.

Last, if I know one thing for sure, it’s that you can do small things inside

your mind that will lead to big changes in your brain and your experience of
living. I’ve seen this happen again and again with people I’ve known as a
psychologist or as a meditation teacher, and I’ve seen it in my own thoughts
and feelings as well. You really can nudge your whole being in a better
direction every day.

When you change your brain, you change your life.

## chapter 1

# The Self-Transforming Brain

_The principal activities of brains are making changes in themselves._

—Marvin L. Minsky

When your mind changes, your brain changes, too. In the saying from the
work of the psychologist Donald Hebb: when neurons fire together, they
wire together—mental activity actually creates new neural structures (Hebb
1949; LeDoux 2003). As a result, even fleeting thoughts and feelings can
leave lasting marks on your brain, much like a spring shower can leave little
trails on a hillside.

For example, taxi drivers in London—whose job requires remembering

lots of twisty streets—develop a larger hippocampus (a key brain region for
making visual-spatial memories), since that part of the brain gets an extra
workout (Maguire et al. 2000). As you become a happier person, the left
frontal region of your brain becomes more active (Davidson 2004).

What flows through your mind sculpts your brain. Thus, _you can use_

_your mind to change your brain for the better_ —which will benefit your
whole being, and every other person whose life you touch.

This book aims to show you how. You’ll learn what the brain is doing

when the mind is happy, loving, and wise. And you’ll learn many ways to
activate these brain states, strengthening them a bit each time. This will
give you the ability to gradually rewire your own brain—from the inside
out—for greater well-being, fulfillment in your relationships, and inner
peace.

## Your Brain—Basic Facts


-----

Your brain is three pounds of tofu-like tissue containing 1.1 trillion
cells, including 100 billion _neurons_ . On average, each neuron
receives about five thousand connections, called _synapses_ , from
other neurons (Linden 2007).
At its receiving synapses, a neuron gets signals—usually as a burst
of chemicals called _neurotransmitters_ —from other neurons. Signals
tell a neuron either to fire or not; whether it fires depends mainly on
the combination of signals it receives each moment. In turn, when a
neuron fires, it sends signals to other neurons through its
transmitting synapses, telling them to fire or not.
A typical neuron fires 5– 50 times a second. In the time it takes you
to read the bullet points in this box, literally quadrillions of signals
will travel inside your head.
Each neural signal is a bit of information; your nervous system
moves information around like your heart moves blood around. All
that information is what we define broadly as the _mind_ , most of
which is forever outside your awareness. In our use of the term, the
“mind” includes the signals that regulate the stress response, the
knowledge of how to ride a bike, personality tendencies, hopes and
dreams, and the meaning of the words you’re reading here.
The brain is the primary mover and shaper of the mind. It’s so busy
that, even though it’s only 2 percent of the body’s weight, it uses
20– 25 percent of its oxygen and glucose (Lammert 2008). Like a
refrigerator, it’s always humming away, performing its functions;


-----

consequently, it uses about the same amount of energy whether
you’re deep asleep or thinking hard (Raichle and Gusnard 2002).
The number of possible combinations of 100 billion neurons firing
or not is approximately 10 to the millionth power, or 1 followed by a
million zeros, in principle; this is the number of possible states of
your brain. To put this quantity in perspective, the number of atoms
in the universe is estimated to be “only” about 10 to the eightieth
power.
Conscious mental events are based on temporary coalitions of
synapses that form and disperse—usually within seconds—like
eddies in a stream (Rabinovich, Huerta, and Laurent 2008). Neurons
can also make lasting circuits, strengthening their connections to
each other as a result of mental activity.
The brain works as a whole system; thus, attributing some function
—such as attention or emotion—to just one part of it is usually a
simplification.
Your brain interacts with other systems in your body—which in turn
interact with the world—plus it’s shaped by the mind as well. In the
largest sense, your mind is made by your brain, body, natural world,
and human culture—as well as by the mind itself (Thompson and
Varela 2001). We’re simplifying things when we refer to the brain as
the basis of the mind.
The mind and brain interact with each other so profoundly that
they’re best understood as a single, co-dependent, mind/brain
system.

## An Unprecedented Opportunity

Much as the microscope revolutionized biology, in the past few decades
new research tools such as functional MRIs have led to a dramatic increase
in scientific knowledge about the mind and brain. As a result, we now have
many more ways to become happier and more effective in daily life.


-----

Meanwhile, there’s been a growing interest in the contemplative

traditions, which have been investigating the mind—and thus the brain—for
thousands of years, quieting the mind/brain enough to catch its softest
murmurs and developing sophisticated ways to transform it. If you want to
get good at anything, it helps to study those who have already mastered that
skill, such as top chefs on TV if you like to cook. Therefore, if you’d like to
feel more happiness, inner strength, clarity, and peace, it makes sense to
learn from contemplative practitioners—both dedicated lay people and
monastics—who’ve really pursued the cultivation of these qualities.

Although “contemplative” may sound exotic, you’ve been contemplative

if you’ve ever meditated, prayed, or just looked at the stars with a sense of
wonder. The world has many contemplative traditions, most of which are
associated with its major religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Islam,
Hinduism, and Buddhism. Of these, science has engaged Buddhism the
most. Like science, Buddhism encourages people to take nothing on faith
alone and does not require a belief in God. It also has a detailed model of
the mind that translates well to psychology and neurology. Consequently,
with great respect for other contemplative traditions, we’ll draw particularly
on Buddhist perspectives and methods.


Imagine each of these disciplines—psychology, neurology, and

contemplative practice—as a circle (figure 1).

Figure 1: The Intersection of the Three Disciplines


-----

The discoveries being made at that intersection are only just starting to

show their promise, but scientists, clinicians, and contemplatives have
already learned a great deal about the brain states that underlie wholesome
mental states and how to activate those brain states. These important
discoveries give you a great ability to influence your own mind. You can
use that ability to reduce any distress or dysfunction, increase well-being,
and support spiritual practice; these are the central activities of what could
be called the _path of awakening_ , and our aim is to use brain science to help
you travel far and well upon it. No book can give you the brain of a
Buddha, but by better understanding the mind and brain of people who’ve
gone a long way down this path, you can develop more of their joyful,
caring, and insightful qualities within your own mind and brain as well.


## The Awakening Brain

Richard and I both believe that something transcendental is involved with

the mind, consciousness, and the path of awakening—call it God, Spirit,


-----

Buddha-nature, the Ground, or by no name at all. Whatever it is, by
definition it’s beyond the physical universe. Since it cannot be proven one
way or another, it is important—and consistent with the spirit of science—
to respect it as a possibility.

That said, more and more studies are showing how greatly the mind

depends on the brain. For example, as the brain develops in childhood, so
does the mind; if the brain is ever damaged, so is the mind. Subtle shifts in
brain chemistry will alter mood, concentration, and memory (Meyer and
Quenzer 2004). Using powerful magnets to suppress the emotionprocessing limbic system changes how people make moral judgments
(Knoch et al. 2006). Even some spiritual experiences correlate with neural
activities (Vaitl et al. 2005).

Any aspect of the mind that is not transcendental must rely upon the

physical processes of the brain. Mental activity, whether conscious or
unconscious, maps to neural activity, much like a picture of a sunset on
your computer screen maps to a pattern of magnetic charges on your hard
drive. Apart from potential transcendental factors, the brain is the necessary
and proximally sufficient condition for the mind; it’s only _proximally_
sufficient because the brain is nested in a larger network of biological and
cultural causes and conditions, and is affected itself by the mind.

Of course, no one yet knows exactly _how_ the brain makes the mind, or

how—as Dan Siegel puts it—the mind uses the brain to make the mind. It’s
sometimes said that the greatest remaining scientific questions are: What
caused the Big Bang? What is the grand unified theory that integrates
quantum mechanics and general relativity? And what is the relationship
between the mind and the brain, especially regarding conscious experience?
The last question is up there with the other two because it is as difficult to
answer, and as important.

To use an analogy, after Copernicus, most educated people accepted that

the earth revolved around the sun. But no one knew how that actually
happened. Roughly 150 years later, Isaac Newton developed the laws of
gravity, which began to explain how the earth went about the sun. Then,
after 200 more years, Einstein refined Newton’s explanation through the
theory of general relativity. It could be 350 years, and maybe longer, before
we completely understand the relationship between the brain and the mind.


-----

But meanwhile, a reasonable working hypothesis is that _the mind is what_
_the brain does._

Therefore, an awakening mind means an awakening brain. Throughout

history, unsung men and women and great teachers alike have cultivated
remarkable mental states by generating remarkable brain states. For
instance, when experienced Tibetan practitioners go deep into meditation,
they produce uncommonly powerful and pervasive gamma _brainwaves_ of
electrical activity, in which unusually large regions of neural real estate
pulse in synchrony 30– 80 times a second (Lutz et al. 2004), integrating and
unifying large territories of the mind. So, with a deep bow to the
transcendental, we will stay within the frame of Western science and see
what modern neuropsychology, informed by contemplative practice, offers
in the way of effective methods for experiencing greater happiness, love,
and wisdom.

To be sure: these methods will not replace traditional spiritual practices.

You don’t need an EEG or a Ph.D. in neuroscience to observe your
experience and the world, and become a happier and kinder person. But
understanding how to affect your own brain can be very helpful, especially
for people who do not have time for intensive practice, such as the 24/7
grinding and polishing of monastic life.

## The Causes of Suffering

Although life has many pleasures and joys, it also contains considerable

discomfort and sorrow—the unfortunate side effect of three strategies that
evolved to help animals, including us, pass on their genes. For sheer
survival, these strategies work great, but they also lead to suffering (as we’ll
explore in depth in the two next chapters). To summarize, whenever a
strategy runs into trouble, uncomfortable—sometimes even agonizing—
alarm signals pulse through the nervous system to set the animal back on
track. But trouble comes all the time, since each strategy contains inherent
contradictions, as the animal tries to:

Separate what is actually connected, in order to create a boundary
between itself and the world


-----

Stabilize what keeps changing, in order to maintain its internal
systems within tight ranges
Hold onto fleeting pleasures and escape inevitable pains, in order to
approach opportunities and avoid threats

Most animals don’t have nervous systems complex enough to allow these

strategies’ alarms to grow into significant distress. But our vastly more
developed brain is fertile ground for a harvest of suffering. Only we humans
worry about the future, regret the past, and blame ourselves for the present.
We get frustrated when we can’t have what we want, and disappointed
when what we like ends. We suffer _that_ we suffer. We get upset about being
in pain, angry about dying, sad about waking up sad yet another day. This
kind of suffering—which encompasses most of our unhappiness and
dissatisfaction—is constructed by the brain. It is made up. Which is ironic,
poignant—and supremely hopeful.

For if the brain is the cause of suffering, it can also be its cure.

## Virtue, Mindfulness, and Wisdom

More than two thousand years ago, a young man named Siddhartha—not

yet enlightened, not yet called the Buddha—spent many years training his
mind and thus his brain. On the night of his awakening, he looked deep
inside his mind (which reflected and revealed the underlying activities of
his brain) and saw there both the causes of suffering and the path to
freedom from suffering. Then, for forty years, he wandered northern India,
teaching all who would listen how to:

Cool the fires of greed and hatred to live with integrity
Steady and concentrate the mind to see through its confusions
Develop liberating insight

In short, he taught virtue, mindfulness (also called concentration), and

wisdom. These are the three pillars of Buddhist practice, as well as the
wellsprings of everyday well-being, psychological growth, and spiritual
realization.


-----

_Virtue_ simply involves regulating your actions, words, and thoughts to

create benefits rather than harms for yourself and others. In your brain,
virtue draws on top-down direction from the _prefrontal cortex_
(PFC);“prefrontal” means the most forward parts of the brain, just behind
and above the forehead, and your “cortex” is the outer layer of the brain (its
Latin root means “bark”). Virtue also relies on bottom-up calming from the
_parasympathetic_ nervous system and positive emotions from the _limbic_
system. You’ll learn how to work with the circuitry of these systems in
chapter 5. Further on, we’ll explore virtue in relationships, since that’s
where it’s often most challenged, and then build on that foundation to
nurture the brain states of empathy, kindness, and love (see chapters 8, 9,
and 10).

_Mindfulness_ involves the skillful use of attention to both your inner and

outer worlds. Since your brain learns mainly from what you attend to,
mindfulness is the doorway to taking in good experiences and making them
a part of yourself (we’ll discuss how to do this in chapter 4). We’ll explore
ways to activate the brain states that promote mindfulness, including to the
point of deep meditative absorption, in chapters 11 and 12.

_Wisdom_ is applied common sense, which you acquire in two steps. First,

you come to understand what hurts and what helps—in other words, the
causes of suffering and the path to its end (the focus of chapters 2 and 3).
Then, based on this understanding, you let go of those things that hurt and
strengthen those that help (chapters 6 and 7). As a result, over time you’ll
feel more connected with everything, more serene about how all things
change and end, and more able to meet pleasure and pain without grasping
after the one and struggling with the other. Finally, chapter 13 addresses
what is perhaps the most seductive and subtle challenge to wisdom: the
sense of being a self who is separate from and vulnerable to the world.

**Regulation, Learning, and Selection**

Virtue, mindfulness, and wisdom are supported by the three fundamental

functions of the brain: regulation, learning, and selection. Your brain
regulates itself—and other bodily systems—through a combination of
excitatory and inhibitory activity: green lights and red lights. It learns
through forming new circuits and strengthening or weakening existing ones.


-----

And it selects whatever experience has taught it to value; for example, even
an earthworm can be trained to pick a particular path to avoid an electric
shock.

These three functions—regulation, learning, and selection—operate at all

levels of the nervous system, from the intricate molecular dance at the tip of
a synapse to the whole-brain integration of control, competence, and
discernment. All three functions are involved in any important mental
activity.

Nonetheless, each pillar of practice corresponds quite closely to one of

the three fundamental neural functions. Virtue relies heavily on regulation,
both to excite positive inclinations and to inhibit negative ones.
Mindfulness leads to new learning—since attention shapes neural circuits—
and draws upon past learning to develop a steadier and more concentrated
awareness. Wisdom is a matter of making choices, such as letting go of
lesser pleasures for the sake of greater ones. Consequently, developing
virtue, mindfulness, and wisdom in your mind depends on improving
regulation, learning, and selection in your brain. Strengthening the three
neural functions—which you’ll learn to do in the pages ahead—thus
buttresses the pillars of practice.

## Inclining the Mind

When you set out on the path of awakening, you begin wherever you are.

Then—with time, effort, and skillful means—virtue, mindfulness, and
wisdom gradually strengthen and you feel happier and more loving. Some
traditions describe this process as an uncovering of the true nature that was
always present; others frame it as a transformation of your mind and body.
Of course, these two aspects of the path of awakening support each other.

On the one hand, your true nature is both a refuge and a resource for the

sometimes difficult work of psychological growth and spiritual practice. It’s
a remarkable fact that the people who have gone the very deepest into the
mind—the sages and saints of every religious tradition—all say essentially
the same thing: your fundamental nature is pure, conscious, peaceful,
radiant, loving, and wise, and it is joined in mysterious ways with the
ultimate underpinnings of reality, by whatever name we give That.


-----

Although your true nature may be hidden momentarily by stress and worry,
anger and unfulfilled longings, it still continues to exist. Knowing this can
be a great comfort.

On the other hand, working with the mind and body to encourage the

development of what’s wholesome—and the uprooting of what’s not—is
central to every path of psychological and spiritual development. Even if
practice is a matter of “removing the obscurations” to true nature—to
borrow a phrase from Tibetan Buddhism—the clearing of these is a
progressive process of training, purification, and transformation.
Paradoxically, it takes time to become what we already are.

In either case, these changes in the mind—uncovering inherent purity and

cultivating wholesome qualities—reflect changes in the brain. By
understanding better how the brain works and changes—how it gets
emotionally hijacked or settles into calm virtue; how it creates distractibility
or fosters mindful attention; how it makes harmful choices or wise ones—
you can take more control of your brain, and therefore your mind. This will
make your development of greater well-being, lovingness, and insight
easier and more fruitful, and help you go as far as you possibly can on your
own path of awakening.

## Being on Your Own Side

It’s a general moral principle that the more power you have over

someone, the greater your duty is to use that power benevolently. Well, who
is the one person in the world you have the greatest power over? It’s your
future self. You hold that life in your hands, and what it will be depends on
how you care for it.

One of the central experiences of my life occurred one evening around

Thanksgiving, when I was about six years old. I remember standing across
the street from our house, on the edge of cornfields in Illinois, seeing ruts in
the dark soil filled with water from a recent rain. On the distant hills, tiny
lights twinkled. I felt quiet and clear inside, and sad about the unhappiness
that night in my home. Then it came to me very powerfully: it was up to
_me_ , and no one else, to find my way over time toward those faraway lights
and the possibility of happiness they represented.


-----

That moment has stayed with me because of what it taught me about

what is and isn’t within our control. It’s impossible to change the past or the
present: you can only accept all that as it is. But you _can_ tend to the causes
of a better future. Most of the ways you’ll do this are small and humble. To
use examples from later in this book, you could take a very full inhalation
in a tense meeting to force a long exhalation, thus activating the calming
parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). Or, when remembering an
upsetting experience, recall the feeling of being with someone who loves
you—which will gradually infuse the upsetting memory with a positive
feeling. Or, to steady the mind, deliberately prolong feelings of happiness as
this will increase levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which will help
your attention stay focused.

These little actions really add up over time. Every day, ordinary activities

—as well as any personal growth or spiritual practices—contain dozens of
opportunities to change your brain from the inside out. You really do have
that power, which is a wonderful thing in a world full of forces beyond your
control. A single raindrop doesn’t have much effect, but if you have enough
raindrops and enough time, you can carve a Grand Canyon.

But to take these steps, you have to be on your own side. That may not be

so easy at first; most people bring less kindness to themselves than to
others. To get on your own side, it can be helpful to make a convincing case
for tending to the causes that will change your brain for the better. For
example, please consider these facts:

You were once a young child, just as worthy of care as any other.
Can you see yourself as a child? Wouldn’t you wish the best for that
little person? The same is true today: you are a human being like
any other—and just as deserving of happiness, love, and wisdom.
Progressing along your path of awakening will make you more
effective in your work and relationships. Think about the many
ways that others will benefit from you being more good-humored,
warm-hearted, and savvy. Nurturing your own development isn’t
selfish. It’s actually a great gift to other people.

## The World on the Edge of a Sword


-----

Perhaps most important of all, consider the ripples spreading out from

your own growth, imperceptibly but genuinely helping a world full of
greed, confusion, fear, and anger. Our world is poised on the edge of a
sword, and it could tip either way. Across the planet, slowly but surely,
we’re seeing increasing democratization, a growing number of grassroots
organizations, and more understanding of our fragile interconnectedness.
On the other hand, the world is getting hotter, military technologies are
increasingly lethal, and a billion people go to sleep hungry every night.

The tragedy and the opportunity of this moment in history are exactly the

same: the natural and technical resources needed to pull us back from the
brink _already exist_ . The issue is not a lack of resources. It is a lack of will
and restraint, of attention to what’s truly happening, and of enlightened selfinterest—a shortage, in other words, of virtue, mindfulness, and wisdom.

As you and other people become increasingly skillful with the mind—

and thus the brain—that could help tip our world in a better direction.

## chapter 1: Key Points

What happens in your mind changes your brain, both temporarily
and in lasting ways; neurons that fire together wire together. And
what happens in your brain changes your mind, since the brain and
mind are a single, integrated system.
Therefore, you can use your mind to change your brain to benefit
your mind—and everyone else whose life you touch.
People who have practiced deeply in the contemplative traditions
are the “Olympic athletes” of the mind. Learning how they’ve
trained their minds (and thus their brains) reveals powerful ways to
have more happiness, love, and wisdom.
The brain evolved to help you survive, but its three primary survival
strategies also make you suffer.
Virtue, mindfulness, and wisdom are the pillars of everyday wellbeing, personal growth, and spiritual practice; they draw on the
three fundamental neural functions of regulation, learning, and
selection.


-----

The path of awakening involves both transforming the mind/brain
and uncovering the wonderful true nature that was there all along.
Small positive actions every day will add up to large changes over
time, as you gradually build new neural structures. To keep at it, you
need to be on your own side.
Wholesome changes in the brains of many people could help tip the
world in a better direction.

# The Evolution of Suffering

_Nothing in biology makes sense except in light of evolution._

—Theodosius Dobzhansky

There’s a lot about life that’s wonderful, but it has its hard parts, too. Look
at the faces around you—they probably hold a fair amount of strain,
disappointment, and worry. And you know your own frustrations and
sorrows as well. The pangs of living range from subtle loneliness and
dismay, to moderate stress, hurt, and anger, and then to intense trauma and
anguish. This whole range is what we mean by the word, _suffering_ . A lot of
suffering is mild but chronic, such as a background sense of anxiety,
irritability, or lack of fulfillment. It’s natural to want less of this. And in its
place, more contentment, love, and peace.

To make any problem better, you need to understand its causes. That’s

why all the great physicians, psychologists, and spiritual teachers have been
master diagnosticians. For example, in his Four Noble Truths, the Buddha
identified an ailment (suffering), diagnosed its cause (craving: a compelling
sense of need for something), specified its cure (freedom from craving), and
prescribed a treatment (the Eightfold Path).

This chapter examines suffering in light of evolution in order to diagnose

its sources in your brain. When you understand _why_ you feel nervous,
annoyed, hassled, driven, blue, or inadequate, those feelings have less
power over you. This by itself can bring some relief. Your understanding
will also help you make better use of the “prescriptions” in the rest of this
book.

## The Evolving Brain


-----

Life began around 3.5 billion years ago. Multicelled creatures first
appeared about 650 million years ago. (When you get a cold,
remember that microbes had nearly a three-billion-year head-start!)
By the time the earliest jellyfish arose about 600 million years ago,
animals had grown complex enough that their sensory and motor
systems needed to communicate with each other; thus the
beginnings of neural tissue. As animals evolved, so did their
nervous systems, which slowly developed a central headquarters in
the form of a brain.
Evolution builds on preexisting capabilities. Life’s progression can
be seen inside your own brain, in terms of what Paul MacLean
(1990) referred to as the reptilian, paleomammalian, and
neomammalian levels of development (see figure 2; all figures are
somewhat inexact and for illustrative purposes only).
Cortical tissues that are relatively recent, complex, conceptualizing,
slow, and motivationally diffuse sit atop _subcortical_ and _brain-stem_
structures that are ancient, simplistic, concrete, fast, and
motivationally intense. (The subcortical region lies in the center of
your brain, beneath the cortex and on top of the brain stem; the brain
stem roughly corresponds to the “reptilian brain” seen in figure 2.)
As you go through your day, there’s a kind of lizard-squirrelmonkey brain in your head shaping your reactions from the bottom
up.

Figure 2: The Evolving Brain


-----

Nonetheless, the modern cortex has great influence over the rest of
the brain, and it’s been shaped by evolutionary pressures to develop
ever-improving abilities to parent, bond, communicate, cooperate,
and love (Dunbar and Shultz 2007).
The cortex is divided into two “hemispheres” connected by the
_corpus callosum_ . As we evolved, the left hemisphere (in most
people) came to focus on sequential and linguistic processing while
the right hemisphere specialized in holistic and visual-spatial
processing; of course, the two halves of your brain work closely
together. Many neural structures are duplicated so that there is one
in each hemisphere; nonetheless, the usual convention is to refer to a
structure in the singular (e.g., the hippocampus).


-----

## Three Survival Strategies

Over hundreds of millions of years of evolution, our ancestors developed
three fundamental strategies for survival:

Creating separations—in order to form boundaries between
themselves and the world, and between one mental state and another
Maintaining stability—in order to keep physical and mental systems
in a healthy balance
Approaching opportunities and avoiding threats—in order to gain
things that promote offspring, and escape or resist things that don’t

These strategies have been extraordinarily effective for survival. But

Mother Nature doesn’t care how they _feel_ . To motivate animals, including
ourselves, to follow these strategies and pass on their genes, neural
networks evolved to create pain and distress under certain conditions: when
separations break down, stability is shaken, opportunities disappoint, and
threats loom. Unfortunately, these conditions happen all the time, because:

Everything is connected.
Everything keeps changing.
Opportunities routinely remain unfulfilled or lose their luster, and
many threats are inescapable (e.g., aging and death)

Let’s see how all this makes you suffer.

## Not So Separate

The parietal _lobes_ of the brain are located in the upper back of the head (a
“lobe” is a rounded swelling of the cortex). For most people, the left lobe
establishes that the body is distinct from the world, and the right lobe
indicates where the body is compared to features in its environment. The
result is an automatic, underlying assumption along the lines of _I am_
_separate and independent._ Although this is true in some ways, in many
important ways it is not.


-----

**Not So Distinct**

To live, an organism must _metabolize_ : it must exchange matter and

energy with its environment. Consequently, over the course of a year, many
of the atoms in your body are replaced by new ones. The energy you use to
get a drink of water comes from sunshine working its way up to you
through the food chain—in a real sense, light lifts the cup to your lips. The
apparent wall between your body and the world is more like a picket fence.

And between your mind and the world, it’s like a line painted on the

sidewalk. Language and culture enter and pattern your mind from the
moment of birth (Han and Northoff 2008). Empathy and love naturally
attune you to other people, so your mind moves into resonance with theirs
(Siegel 2007). These flows of mental activity go both ways as you influence
others.

Within your mind, there are hardly any lines at all. All its contents flow

into each other, sensations becoming thoughts feelings desires actions and
more sensations. This stream of consciousness correlates with a cascade of
fleeting neural assemblies, each assembly dispersing into the next one,
often in less than a second (Dehaene, Sergent, and Changeux 2003;
Thompson and Varela 2001).

**Not So Independent**

I’m here because a Serbian nationalist assassinated Archduke Ferdinand,

catalyzing World War I—which in turn led to the unlikely meeting of my
mom and dad at an Army dance in 1944. Of course, there are ten thousand
reasons why _anyone_ is here today. How far back should we go? My son—
born with his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck—is here due to
medical technologies developed over hundreds of years.

Or we could go _way_ back: Most of the atoms in your body—including

the oxygen in your lungs and the iron in your blood—were born inside a
star. In the early universe, hydrogen was just about the only element. Stars
are giant fusion reactors that pound together hydrogen atoms, making
heavier elements and releasing lots of energy in the process. The ones that
went nova spewed their contents far and wide. By the time our solar system
started to form, roughly nine billion years after the universe began, enough


-----

large atoms existed to make our planet, to make the hands that hold this
book and the brain that understands these words. Truly, you’re here because
a lot of stars blew up. Your body is made of stardust.

Your mind also depends on countless preceding causes. Think of the life

events and people that have shaped your views, personality, and emotions.
Imagine having been switched at birth and raised by poor shopkeepers in
Kenya or a wealthy oil family in Texas; how different would your mind be
today?

**The Suffering of Separation**

Since we are each connected and interdependent with the world, our

attempts to be separate and independent are regularly frustrated, which
produces painful signals of disturbance and threat. Further, even when our
efforts are temporarily successful, they still lead to suffering. When you
regard the world as “not me at all,” it is potentially unsafe, leading you to
fear and resist it. Once you say, “I am _this_ body apart from the world,” the
body’s frailties become your own. If you think it weighs too much or
doesn’t look right, you suffer. If it’s threatened by illness, aging, and death
—as all bodies are—you suffer.

## Not So Permanent

Your body, brain, and mind contain vast numbers of systems that must
maintain a healthy equilibrium. The problem, though, is that changing
conditions continually disturb these systems, resulting in signals of threat,
pain, and distress—in a word, suffering.

**We Are Dynamically Changing Systems**

Let’s consider a single neuron, one that releases the neurotransmitter

serotonin (see figures 3 and 4). This tiny neuron is both part of the nervous
system and a complex system in its own right that requires multiple
subsystems to keep it running. When it fires, tendrils at the end of its axon
expel a burst of molecules into the synapses—the connections—it makes


-----

with other neurons. Each tendril contains about two hundred little bubbles
called _vesicles_ that are full of the neurotransmitter serotonin (Robinson
2007). Every time the neuron fires, five to ten vesicles spill open. Since a
typical neuron fires around ten times a second, the serotonin vesicles of
each tendril are emptied out every few seconds.

Consequently, busy little molecular machines must either manufacture

new serotonin or recycle loose serotonin floating around the neuron. Then
they need to build vesicles, fill them with serotonin, and move them close to
where the action is, at the tip of each tendril. That’s a lot of processes to
keep in balance, with many things that could go wrong—and serotonin
metabolism is just one of the thousands of systems in your body.

## A Typical Neuron

Neurons are the basic building blocks of the nervous system; their
main function is to communicate with each other across tiny
junctions called synapses. While there are many sorts of neurons,
their basic design is pretty similar.
The cell body sends out spikes called _dendrites_ which receive
neurotransmitters from other neurons. (Some neurons communicate
directly with each other through electrical impulses.)
Simplifying some, the millisecond-by-millisecond sum of all the
excitatory and inhibitory signals a neuron receives determines
whether or not it will fire.
When a neuron fires, an electrochemical wave ripples down its
_axon_ , the fiber extending toward the neurons it sends signals to. This
releases neurotransmitters into its synapses with receiving neurons,
either inhibiting them or exciting them to fire in turn.
Nerve signals are sped up by _myelin_ , a fatty substance that insulates
axons.

Figure 1: A (Simplified) Neuron


-----

The gray matter of your brain is composed largely of the cell bodies
of neurons. There is also white matter, made up of the axons and the
_glial_ cells; glial cells perform metabolic support functions such as
wrapping axons in myelin and recycling neurotransmitters.
Neuronal cell bodies are like 100 billion on-off switches connected
by their axonal “wires” in an intricate network inside your head.

Figure 4: A Synapse (magnified in the inset)


-----

**The Challenges of Maintaining an Equilibrium**

For you to stay healthy, each system in your body and mind must balance

two conflicting needs. On the one hand, it must remain open to inputs
during ongoing transactions with its local environment (Thompson 2007);
closed systems are dead systems. On the other hand, each system must also
preserve a fundamental stability, staying centered around a good set-point
and within certain ranges—not too hot, nor too cold. For example,
inhibition from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and arousal from the limbic
system must balance each other: too much inhibition and you feel numb
inside, too much arousal and you feel overwhelmed.

**Signals of Threat**

To keep each of your systems in balance, sensors register its state (as the

thermometer does inside a thermostat) and send signals to regulators to
restore equilibrium if the system gets out of range (i.e., turn the furnace on
or off). Most of this regulation stays out of your awareness. But some
signals for corrective action are so important that they bubble up into
consciousness. For example, if your body gets too cold, you feel chilled; if
it gets too hot, you feel like you’re baking.

These consciously experienced signals are unpleasant, in part because

they carry a sense of threat—a call to restore equilibrium before things slide
too far too fast down the slippery slope. The call may come softly, with a
sense of unease, or loudly, with alarm, even panic. However it comes, it
mobilizes your brain to do whatever it takes to get you back in balance.

This mobilization usually comes with feelings ofcraving; these range

from quiet longings to a desperate sense of compulsion. It is interesting that
the word for craving in Pali—the language of early Buddhism—is _tanha_ ,
the root of which means thirst. The word “thirst” conveys the visceral
power of threat signals, even when they have nothing to do with life or
limb, such as the possibility of being rejected. Threat signals are effective
precisely because they’re unpleasant—because they make you suffer,
sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. You want them to stop.


-----

**Everything Keeps Changing**

Occasionally, threat signals do stop for a while—just as long as every

system stays in balance. But since the world is always changing, there are
endless disturbances in the equilibria of your body, mind, and relationships.
The regulators of the systems of your life, from the molecular bottom all the
way up to the interpersonal top, must keep trying to impose static order on
inherently unstable processes.

Consider the impermanence of the physical world, from the volatility of

quantum particles to our own Sun, which will someday swell into a red
giant and swallow the Earth. Or consider the turbulence of your nervous
system; for example, regions in the PFC that support consciousness are
updated five to eight times a second (Cunningham and Zelazo 2007).

This neurological instability underlies all states of mind. For example,

every thought involves a momentary partitioning of streaming neural traffic
into a coherent assembly of synapses that must soon disperse into fertile
disorder to allow other thoughts to emerge (Atmanspacher and Graben
2007). Observe even a single breath, and you will experience its sensations
changing, dispersing, and disappearing soon after they arise.

_Everything_ changes. That’s the universal nature of outer reality and inner

experience. Therefore, there’s no end to disturbed equilibria as long as you
live. But to help you survive, your brain keeps trying to stop the river,
struggling to hold dynamic systems in place, to find fixed patterns in this
variable world, and to construct permanent plans for changing conditions.
Consequently, your brain is forever chasing after the moment that has just
passed, trying to understand and control it.

It’s as if we live at the edge of a waterfall, with each moment rushing at

us—experienced only and always _now_ at the lip—and then zip, it’s over the
edge and gone. But the brain is forever clutching at what has just surged by.

## Not So Pleasant or Painful

In order to pass on their genes, our animal ancestors had to choose correctly
many times a day whether to approach something or avoid it. Today,
humans approach and avoid mental states as well as physical objects; for
example, we pursue self-worth and push away shame. Nonetheless, for all


-----

its sophistication, human approaching and avoiding draws on much the
same neural circuitry used by a monkey to look for bananas or a lizard to
hide under a rock.

**The Feeling Tone of Experience**

How does your brain decide if something should be approached or

avoided? Let’s say you’re walking in the woods; you round a bend and
suddenly see a curvy shape on the ground right smack in front of you. To
simplify a complex process, during the first few tenths of a second, light
bouncing off this curved object is sent to the _occipital_ cortex (which
handles visual information) for processing into a meaningful image (see
figure 5). Then the occipital cortex sends representations of this image in
two directions: to the hippocampus, for evaluation as a potential threat or
opportunity, and to the PFC and other parts of the brain for more
sophisticated—and time-consuming—analysis.

Figure 5: You See a Potential Threat or Opportunity

Just in case, your hippocampus immediately compares the image to its

short list of jump-first-think-later dangers. It quickly finds curvy shapes on
its danger list, causing it to send a high-priority alert to your _amygdala_ :
“Watch out!” The amygdala—which is like an alarm bell—then pulses both
a general warning throughout your brain and a special fast-track signal to
your fight-or-flight neural and hormonal systems (Rasia-Filho, Londero,
and Achaval 2000). We’ll explore the details of the fight-or-flight cascade


-----

in the next chapter; the point here is that a second or so after you spot the
curving shape, you jump back in alarm.

Meanwhile, the powerful but relatively slow PFC has been pulling

information out of long-term memory to figure out whether the darn thing is
a snake or a stick. As a few more seconds tick by, the PFC zeros in on the
object’s inert nature—and the fact that several people ahead of you walked
past it without saying anything—and concludes that it’s only a stick.

Throughout this episode, everything you experienced was either pleasant,

unpleasant, or neutral. At first there were neutral or pleasant sights as you
strolled along the path, then unpleasant fear at a potential snake, and finally
pleasant relief at the realization that it was just a stick. That aspect of
experience—whether it is pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—is called, in
Buddhism, its _feeling tone_ (or, in Western psychology, its _hedonic tone_ ).
The feeling tone is produced mainly by your amygdala (LeDoux 1995) and
then broadcast widely. It’s a simple but effective way to tell your brain as a
whole what to do each moment: approach pleasant carrots, avoid unpleasant
sticks, and move on from anything else.

## Key Neurochemicals

These are the major chemicals inside your brain that affect neural activity;
they have many functions, and we’ve listed here the ones that are relevant
to this book.

**Primary Neurotransmitters**

Glutamate—excites receiving neurons.
GABA—inhibits receiving neurons.

**Neuromodulators**

These substances—sometimes also called neurotransmitters—influence the
primary neurotransmitters. Because they’re released widely within the
brain, they have a powerful effect.


-----

Serotonin—regulates mood, sleep, and digestion; most

antidepressants aim at increasing its effects.
Dopamine—involved with rewards and attention; promotes
approach behaviors.
Norepinephrine—alerts and arouses.
Acetylcholine—promotes wakefulness and learning.

**Neuropeptides**

These neuromodulators are built from _peptides,_ a particular kind of organic
molecule.

Opioids—buffer stress, provide soothing and reduce pain, and
produce pleasure (e.g., runner’s high); these include endorphins.
Oxytocin—promotes nurturing behaviors toward children and
bonding in couples; associated with blissful closeness and love;
women have more oxytocin than men.
Vasopressin—supports pair bonding; in men it may promote
aggressiveness toward sexual rivals.

**Other Neurochemicals**

Cortisol—released by the adrenal glands during the stress response;
stimulates the amygdala and inhibits the hippocampus.
Estrogen—the brains of both men and women contain estrogen
receptors; affects libido, mood, and memory.

**Chasing Carrots**

Two major neural systems keep you chasing carrots. The first system is

based on the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine-releasing neurons
become more active when you encounter things that are linked to rewards
in the past—for example, if you get a message from a good friend you
haven’t seen for a few months. These neurons also rev up when you
encounter something that could offer rewards in the future—such as your


-----

friend saying she wants to take you to lunch. In your mind, this neural
activity produces a motivating sense of desire: you want to call her back.
When you do have lunch, a part of your brain called the _cingulate cortex_
(about the size of your finger, on the interior edge of each hemisphere)
tracks whether the rewards you expected—fun with your friend, good food
—actually arrive (Eisenberger and Lieberman 2004). If they do, dopamine
levels stay steady. But if you’re disappointed—maybe your friend is in a
bad mood—the cingulate sends out a signal that lowers dopamine levels.
Falling dopamine registers in subjective experience as an unpleasant feeling
tone—a dissatisfaction and discontent—that stimulates craving(broadly
defined) for something that will restore its levels.

The second system, based on several other neuromodulators, is the

biochemical source of the pleasant feeling tones that come from the actual
—and anticipated—carrots in life. When these “pleasure chemicals”—
natural opioids (including endorphins), oxytocin, and norepinephrine—
surge into your synapses, they strengthen the neural circuits that are active,
making them more likely to fire together in the future. Imagine a toddler
trying to eat a spoonful of pudding. After many misses, his perceptualmotor neurons finally get it right, leading to waves of pleasure chemicals
which help cement the synaptic connections that created the specific
movements that slipped the spoon into his mouth.

In essence, this pleasure system highlights whatever triggered it, prompts

you to pursue those rewards again, and strengthens the behaviors that make
you successful in getting them. It works hand in hand with the dopaminebased system. For example, slaking your thirst feels good both because the
discontent of low dopamine leaves, and because the pleasure chemical–
based joy of cool water on a hot day arrives.

**Approaching Involves Suffering**

These two neural systems are necessary for survival. Additionally, you

can use them for positive aims that have nothing to do with passing on
genes. For example, you could increase your motivation to keep doing
something healthy (e.g., exercise) by being really mindful of its rewards,
such as feelings of vitality and strength.

But reaching for what’s pleasant can also make you suffer:


-----

Desiring itself can be an unpleasant experience; even mild longing
is subtly uncomfortable.
When you can’t have things you desire, it’s natural to feel frustrated,
disappointed, and discouraged—perhaps even hopeless and
despairing.
When you do fulfill a desire, the rewards that follow are often not
that great. They’re okay, but look closely at your experience: Is the
cookie really that tasty—especially after the third bite? Was the
satisfaction of the good job review that intense or long lasting?
When rewards are in fact pretty great, many of them still come at a
stiff price—big desserts are an obvious example. Also consider the
rewards of gaining recognition, winning an argument, or getting
others to act a particular way. What is the cost/benefit ratio, _really_ ?
Even if you do get what you want, it’s genuinely great, and it
doesn’t cost much—the gold standard—every pleasant experience
must inevitably change and end. Even the best ones of all. You are
routinely separated from things you enjoy. And someday that
separation will be permanent. Friends drift away, children leave
home, careers end, and eventually your own final breath comes and
goes. Everything that begins must also cease. Everything that comes
together must also disperse. Experiences are thus incapable of being
completely satisfying. They are an unreliable basis for true
happiness.

To use an analogy from the Thai meditation master Ajahn Chah: if

getting upset about something unpleasant is like being bitten by a snake,
grasping for what’s pleasant is like grabbing the snake’s tail; sooner or later,
it will still bite you.

**Sticks Are Stronger than Carrots**

So far, we’ve discussed carrots and sticks as if they were equals. But

actually, sticks are usually more powerful, since your brain is built more for
avoiding than for approaching. That’s because it’s the negative experiences,
not the positive ones, that have generally had the most impact on survival.


-----

For example, imagine our mammalian ancestors dodging dinosaurs in a

worldwide Jurassic Park 70 million years ago. Constantly looking over their
shoulders, alert to the slightest crackle of brush, ready to freeze or bolt or
attack depending on the situation. The quick and the dead. If they missed
out on a carrot—a chance at food or mating, perhaps—they usually had
other opportunities later. But if they failed to duck a stick—like a predator
—then they’d probably be killed, with no chance at any carrots in the
future. The ones that lived to pass on their genes paid a _lot_ of attention to
negative experiences.

Let’s explore six ways your brain keeps you dodging sticks.

**VIGILANCE AND ANXIETY**

When you’re awake and not doing anything in particular, the baseline

resting state of your brain activates a “default network,” and one of its
functions seems to be tracking your environment and body for possible
threats (Raichle et al. 2001). This basic awareness is often accompanied by
a background feeling of anxiety that keeps you vigilant. Try walking
through a store for a few minutes without the least whiff of caution, unease,
or tension. It’s very difficult.

This makes sense because our mammalian, primate, and human ancestors

were prey as well as predators. In addition, most primate social groups have
been full of aggression from males and females alike (Sapolsky 2006). And
in the hominid and then human hunter-gatherer bands of the past couple
million years, violence has been a leading cause of death for men (Bowles
2006). We became anxious for good reason: there was a lot to fear.

**SENSITIVITY TO NEGATIVE INFORMATION**

The brain typically detects negative information faster than positive

information. Take facial expressions, a primary signal of threat or
opportunity for a social animal like us: fearful faces are perceived much
more rapidly than happy or neutral ones, probably fast-tracked by the
amygdala (Yang, Zald, and Blake 2007). In fact, even when researchers
make fearful faces invisible to conscious awareness, the amygdala still
lights up (Jiang and He 2006). The brain is _drawn_ to bad news.


-----

**HIGH-PRIORITY STORAGE**

When an event is flagged as negative, the hippocampus makes sure it’s

stored carefully for future reference. Once burned, twice shy. Your brain is
like Velcro for negative experiences and Teflon for positive ones—even
though most of your experiences are probably neutral or positive.

**NEGATIVE TRUMPS POSITIVE**

Negative events generally have more impact than positive ones. For

example, it’s easy to acquire feelings of learned helplessness from a few
failures, but hard to undo those feelings, even with many successes
(Seligman 2006). People will do more to avoid a loss than to acquire a
comparable gain (Baumeister et al. 2001). Compared to lottery winners,
accident victims usually take longer to return to their original baseline of
happiness (Brickman, Coates, and Janoff-Bulman 1978). Bad information
about a person carries more weight than good information (Peeters and
Czapinski 1990), and in relationships, it typically takes about five positive
interactions to overcome the effects of a single negative one (Gottman
1995).

**LINGERING TRACES**

Even if you’ve unlearned a negative experience, it still leaves an

indelible trace in your brain (Quirk, Repa, and LeDoux 1995). That residue
lies waiting, ready to reactivate if you ever encounter a fear-provoking
event like the previous one.

**VICIOUS CYCLES**

Negative experiences create vicious cycles by making you pessimistic,

overreactive, and inclined to go negative yourself.

**Avoiding Involves Suffering**

As you can see, your brain has a built-in “negativity bias” (Vaish,

Grossman, and Woodward 2008) that primes you for avoidance. This bias
makes you suffer in a variety of ways. For starters, it generates an


-----

unpleasant background of anxiety, which for some people can be quite
intense; anxiety also makes it harder to bring attention inward for selfawareness or contemplative practice, since the brain keeps scanning to
make sure there is no problem. The negativity bias fosters or intensifies
other unpleasant emotions, such as anger, sorrow, depression, guilt, and
shame. It highlights past losses and failures, it downplays present abilities,
and it exaggerates future obstacles. Consequently, the mind continually
tends to render unfair verdicts about a person’s character, conduct, and
possibilities. The weight of those judgments can really wear you down.

## In the Simulator

In Buddhism, it’s said that suffering is the result of craving expressed
through the Three Poisons: greed, hatred, and delusion. These are strong,
traditional terms that cover a broad range of thoughts, words, and deeds,
including the most fleeting and subtle. Greed is a grasping after carrots,
while hatred is an aversion to sticks; both involve craving more pleasure
and less pain. Delusion is a holding onto ignorance about the way things
really are—for example, not seeing how they’re connected and changing.

**Virtual Reality**

Sometimes these poisons are conspicuous; much of the time, however,

they operate in the background of your awareness, firing and wiring quietly
along. They do this by using your brain’s extraordinary capacity to
_represent_ both inner experience and the outer world. For example, the blind
spots in your left and right visual fields don’t look like holes out there in the
world; rather, your brain fills them in, much like photo software shades in
the red eyes of people looking toward a flash. In fact, much of what you see
“out there” is actually manufactured “in here” by your brain, painted in like
computer-generated graphics in a movie. Only a small fraction of the inputs
to your occipital lobe comes directly from the external world; the rest
comes from internal memory stores and perceptual-processing modules
(Raichle 2006). Your brain _simulates_ the world—each of us lives in a
virtual reality that’s close enough to the real thing that we don’t bump into
the furniture.


-----

Inside this simulator—whose neural substrate appears to be centered in

the upper-middle of your PFC (Gusnard et al. 2001)—mini-movies run
continuously. These brief clips are the building blocks of much conscious
mental activity (Niedenthal 2007; Pitcher et al. 2008). For our ancestors,
running simulations of past events promoted survival, as it strengthened the
learning of successful behaviors by repeating their neural firing patterns.
Simulating future events also promoted survival by enabling our ancestors
to compare possible outcomes—in order to pick the best approach—and to
ready potential sensory-motor sequences for immediate action. Over the
past three million years, the brain has tripled in size; much of this expansion
has improved the capabilities of the simulator, suggesting its benefits for
survival.

**Simulations Make You Suffer**

The brain continues to produce simulations today, even when they have

nothing to do with staying alive. Watch yourself daydream or go back over
a relationship problem, and you’ll see the clips playing—little packets of
simulated experiences, usually just seconds long. If you observe them
closely, you’ll spot several troubling things:

By its very nature, the simulator pulls you out of the present
moment. There you are, following a presentation at work, running
an errand, or meditating, and suddenly your mind is a thousand
miles away, caught up in a mini-movie. But it’s only in the present
moment that we find real happiness, love, or wisdom.
In the simulator, pleasures usually seem pretty great, whether you’re
considering a second cupcake or imagining the response you’ll get
to a report at work. But what do you _actually_ feel when you enact
the mini-movie in real life? Is it as pleasant as promised up there on
the screen? Usually not. In truth, most everyday rewards aren’t as
intense as those conjured up in the simulator.
Clips in the simulator contain lots of beliefs: _Of course he’ll say X if_
_I say Y….It’s obvious that they let me down._ Sometimes these are
explicitly verbalized, but much of the time they’re implicit, built
into the plotline. In reality, are the explicit and implicit beliefs in
your simulations _true_ ? Sometimes yes, but often no. Mini-movies


-----

keep us stuck by their simplistic view of the past and by their
defining out of existence real possibilities for the future, such as
new ways to reach out to others or dream big dreams. Their beliefs
are the bars of an invisible cage, trapping you in a life that’s smaller
than the one you could actually have. It’s like being a zoo animal
that’s released into a large park—yet still crouches within the
confines of its old pen.
In the simulator, upsetting events from the past play again and
again, which unfortunately strengthens the neural associations
between an event and its painful feelings. The simulator also
forecasts threatening situations in your future. But in fact, most of
those worrisome events never materialize. And of the ones that do,
often the discomfort you experience is milder and briefer than
predicted. For example, imagine speaking from your heart: this may
trigger a mini-movie ending in rejection and you feeling bad. But in
fact, when you do speak from the heart, doesn’t it typically go pretty
well, with you ending up feeling quite good?

In sum, the simulator takes you out of the present moment and sets you

chasing after carrots that aren’t really so great while ignoring more
important rewards (such as contentment and inner peace). Its mini-movies
are full of limiting beliefs. Besides reinforcing painful emotions, they have
you ducking sticks that never actually come your way or aren’t really all
that bad. And the simulator does this hour after hour, day after day, even in
your dreams—steadily building neural structure, much of which adds to
your suffering.

## Self-Compassion

Each person suffers sometimes, and many people suffer a lot. Compassion
is a natural response to suffering, including your own. Self-compassion isn’t
self-pity, but is simply warmth, concern, and good wishes—just like
compassion for another person. Because self-compassion is more emotional
than self-esteem, it’s actually more powerful for reducing the impact of
difficult conditions, preserving self-worth, and building resilience (Leary et


-----

al. 2007). It also opens your heart, since when you’re closed to your own
suffering, it’s hard to be receptive to suffering in others.


In addition to the everyday suffering of life, the path of awakening itself

contains difficult experiences which also call for compassion. To become
happier, wiser, and more loving, sometimes you have to swim against
ancient currents within your nervous system. For example, in some ways
the three pillars of practice are unnatural: virtue restrains emotional
reactions that worked well on the Serengeti, mindfulness decreases external
vigilance, and wisdom cuts through beliefs that once helped us survive. It
goes against the evolutionary template to undo the causes of suffering, to
feel one with all things, to flow with the changing moment, and to remain
unmoved by pleasant and unpleasant alike. Of course, that doesn’t mean we
shouldn’t do it! It just means we should understand what we’re up against
and have some compassion for ourselves.

To nurture self-compassion and strengthen its neural circuits:

Recall being with someone who really loves you—the feeling of
receiving caring activates the deep attachment system circuitry in
your brain, priming it to give compassion.
Bring to mind someone you naturally feel compassion for, such as a
child or a person you love—this easy flow of compassion arouses its
neural underpinnings (including oxytocin, the _insula_ [which senses
the internal state of your body], and the PFC), “warming them up”
for self-compassion.
Extend this same compassion to yourself—be aware of your own
suffering and extend concern and good wishes toward yourself;
sense compassion sifting down into raw places inside, falling like a
gentle rain that touches everything. The actions related to a feeling
strengthen it (Niedenthal 2007), so place your palm on your cheek


-----

or heart with the tenderness and warmth you’d give a hurt child. Say
phrases in your mind such as _May I be happy again. May the pain of_
_this moment pass._
Overall, open to the sense that you are receiving compassion—deep
down in your brain, the actual source of good feelings doesn’t
matter much; whether the compassion is from you or from another
person, let your sense of being soothed and cared for sink in.

## chapter 2: Key Points

Three fundamental strategies have evolved to help us pass on our
genes: creating separations, stabilizing systems, and approaching
opportunities while avoiding threats.
Although these strategies are very effective for survival, they also
make you suffer.
The effort to maintain separations is at odds with the myriad ways
you’re actually connected with the world and dependent upon it. As
a result, you may feel subtly isolated, alienated, overwhelmed, or as
if you’re in a struggle with the world.
When the systems within your body, mind, and relationships
become unstable, your brain produces uncomfortable signals of
threat. Since everything keeps changing, these signals keep coming.
Your brain colors your experiences with a feeling tone—pleasant,
unpleasant, or neutral—so you’ll approach what’s pleasant, avoid
what’s unpleasant, and move on from what’s neutral.
In particular, we evolved to pay great attention to unpleasant
experiences. This negativity bias overlooks good news, highlights
bad news, and creates anxiety and pessimism.
The brain has a wonderful capacity to simulate experiences, but
there’s a price: the simulator pulls you out of the moment, plus it
sets you chasing pleasures that aren’t that great and resisting pains
that are exaggerated or not even real.
Compassion for yourself helps reduce your suffering.

# The First and Second Dart

_Ultimately, happiness comes down to choosing between the discomfort of_

_becoming aware of your mental afflictions and the discomfort of being_

_ruled by them._

—Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche

Some physical discomfort is unavoidable; it’s a crucial signal to take action
to protect life and limb, like the pain that makes you pull your hand back
from a hot stove. Some mental discomfort is inevitable, too. For example,
as we evolved, growing emotional investments in children and other
members of the band motivated our ancestors to keep those carriers of their
genes alive; understandably, then, we feel distress when dear ones are
threatened and sorrow when they are harmed. We also evolved to care
greatly about our place in the band and in the hearts of others, so it’s normal
to feel hurt if you’re rejected or scorned.

To borrow an expression from the Buddha, inescapable physical or

mental discomfort is the “first dart” of existence. As long as you live and
love, some of those darts will come your way.

## The Darts We Throw Ourselves

First darts are unpleasant to be sure. But then we add our _reactions_ to them.
These reactions are “second darts”—the ones we throw ourselves. Most of
our suffering comes from second darts.

Suppose you’re walking through a dark room at night and stub your toe

on a chair; right after the first dart of pain comes a second dart of anger:
“Who moved that darn chair?!” Or maybe a loved one is cold to you when
you’re hoping for some caring; in addition to the natural drop in the pit of


-----

your stomach (first dart), you might feel unwanted (second dart) as a result
of having been ignored as a child.

Second darts often trigger more second darts through associative neural

networks: you might feel guilt about your anger that someone moved the
chair, or sadness that you feel hurt yet again by someone you love. In
relationships, second darts create vicious cycles: your second-dart reactions
trigger reactions from the other person, which set off more second darts
from you, and so on.

Remarkably, most of our second-dart reactions occur when there is in fact

no first dart anywhere to be found—when there’s no pain inherent in the
conditions we’re reacting to. We _add_ suffering to them. For example,
sometimes I’ll come home from work and the house will be a mess, with
the kids’ stuff all over. That’s the condition. Is there a first dart _in_ the coats
and shoes on the sofa or the clutter covering the counter? No, there isn’t; no
one dropped a brick on me or hurt my children. Do I _have_ to get upset? Not
really. I could ignore the stuff, pick it up calmly, or talk with them about it.
Sometimes I manage to handle it that way. But if I don’t, then the second
darts start landing, tipped with the Three Poisons: greed makes me rigid
about how I want things to be, hatred gets me all bothered and angry, and
delusion tricks me into taking the situation personally.

Saddest of all, some second-dart reactions are to conditions that are

actually _positive_ . If someone pays you a compliment, that’s a positive
situation. But then you might start thinking, with some nervousness and
even a little shame: _Oh, I’m not really that good a person. Maybe they’ll_
_find out I’m a fraud._ Right there, needless second-dart suffering begins.

## Heating Up

Suffering is not abstract or conceptual. It’s _embodied:_ you feel it in your
body, and it proceeds through bodily mechanisms. Understanding the
physical machinery of suffering will help you see it increasingly as an
impersonal condition—unpleasant to be sure, but not worth getting upset
about, which would just bring more second darts.

Suffering cascades through your body via the sympathetic nervous

system (SNS) and the _hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis_ (HPAA) of the


-----

endocrine (hormonal) system. Let’s unscramble this alphabet soup to see
how it all works. While the SNS and HPAA are anatomically distinct, they
are so intertwined that they’re best described together, as an integrated
system. And we’ll focus on reactions dominated by an aversion to sticks
(e.g., fear, anger) rather than a grasping for carrots, since aversive reactions
usually have a bigger impact due to the negativity bias of the brain.

**Alarms Go Off**

Something happens. It might be a car suddenly cutting you off, a put-

down from a coworker, or even just a worrisome thought. Social and
emotional conditions can pack a wallop like physical ones since
psychological pain draws on many of the same neural networks as physical
pain (Eisenberger and Lieberman 2004); this is why getting rejected can
feel as bad as a root canal. Even just anticipating a challenging event—such
as giving a talk next week—can have as much impact as living through it
for real. Whatever the source of the threat, the amygdala sounds the alarm,
setting off several reactions:

The _thalamus_ —the relay station in the middle of your head—sends
a “Wake up!” signal to your brain stem, which in turn releases
stimulating norepinephrine throughout your brain.
The SNS sends signals to the major organs and muscle groups in
your body, readying them for fighting or fleeing.
The hypothalamus—the brain’s primary regulator of the endocrine
system—prompts the pituitary gland to signal the adrenal glands to
release the “stress hormones” _epinephrine_ ( _adrenaline_ ) and _cortisol_ .

**Ready for Action**

Within a second or two of the initial alarm, your brain is on red alert,

your SNS is lit up like a Christmas tree, and stress hormones are washing
through your blood. In other words, you’re at least a little upset. What’s
going on in your body?

Epinephrine increases your heart rate (so your heart can move more

blood) and dilates your pupils (so your eyes gather more light).


-----

Norepinephrine shunts blood to large muscle groups. Meanwhile, the
bronchioles of your lungs dilate for increased gas exchange—enabling you
to hit harder or run faster.

Cortisol suppresses the immune system to reduce inflammation from

wounds. It also revs up stress reactions in two circular ways: First, it causes
the brain stem to stimulate the amygdala further, which increases amygdala
activation of the SNS/HPAA system—which produces more cortisol.
Second, cortisol suppresses hippocampal activity (which normally inhibits
the amygdala); this takes the brakes off the amygdala, leading to yet more
cortisol.

Reproduction is sidelined—no time for sex when you’re running for

cover. The same for digestion: salivation decreases and peristalsis slows
down, so your mouth feels dry and you become constipated.

Your emotions intensify, organizing and mobilizing the whole brain for

action. SNS/HPAA arousal stimulates the amygdala, which is hardwired to
focus on negative information and react intensely to it. Consequently,
feeling stressed sets you up for fear and anger.

As limbic and endocrine activation increases, the relative strength of

executive control from the PFC declines. It’s like being in a car with a
runaway accelerator: the driver has less control over her vehicle. Further,
the PFC is also affected by SNS/HPAA arousal, which pushes appraisals,
attributions of others’ intentions, and priorities in a negative direction: now
the driver of the careening car thinks everybody else is an idiot. For
example, consider the difference between your take on a situation when
you’re upset and your thoughts about it later when you’re calmer.

In the harsh physical and social environments in which we evolved, this

activation of multiple bodily systems helped our ancestors survive. But
what’s the cost of this today, with the chronic low-grade stresses of modern
life?

## Key Parts of Your Brain

Each of these parts of your brain does many things; the functions listed here
are those relevant to this book.

Figure 6: Key Parts of Your Brain


-----

**Prefrontal cortex (PFC)** —sets goals, makes plans, directs action;
shapes emotions, in part by guiding and sometimes inhibiting the
limbic system
**Anterior (frontal) cingulate cortex (ACC)** —steadies attention and
monitors plans; helps integrate thinking and feeling (Yamasaki,
LaBar, and McCarthy 2002); a “cingulate” is a curved bundle of
nerve fibers
**Insula** —senses the internal state of your body, including gut
feelings; helps you be empathic; located on the inside of the
temporal lobes on each side of your head (temporal lobes and insula
not shown in figure 6)
**Thalamus** —the major relay station for sensory information
**Brain stem** —sends neuromodulators such as serotonin and
dopamine to the rest of the brain
**Corpus** **callosum** —passes information between the two

hemispheres of the brain
**Cerebellum** —regulates movement
**Limbic system** —central to emotion and motivation; includes the
basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and pituitary
gland; sometimes also considered to include parts of the cortex (e.g.,
cingulate, insula), but for simplicity we will define it anatomically


-----

in terms of subcortical structures; many parts of the brain besides
the limbic system are involved with emotion
**Basal ganglia** —involved with rewards, stimulation seeking, and
movement; “ganglia” are masses of tissue
**Hippocampus** —forms new memories; detects threats
**Amygdala** —a kind of “alarm bell” that responds particularly to
emotionally charged or negative stimuli (Rasia-Filho, Londero, and
Achaval 2000)
**Hypothalamus** —regulates primal drives such as hunger and sex;
makes oxytocin; activates the pituitary gland
**Pituitary gland** —makes endorphins; triggers stress hormones;
stores and releases oxytocin

## Life on Simmer

Getting fired up for good reason—such as becoming passionate and
enthusiastic, handling emergencies, or being forceful for a good cause—
definitely has its place in life. But second darts are a bad reason to light up
the SNS/HPAA system, and if they become routine, they can push the
needle on your personal stress meter into the red zone. Further, apart from
your individual situation, we live in a pedal-to-the-metal society that relies
on nonstop SNS/HPAA activation; unfortunately, this is completely
unnatural in terms of our evolutionary template.

For all of these reasons, most of us experience ongoing SNS/HPAA

arousal. Even if your pot isn’t boiling over, just simmering along with
second-dart activation is quite unhealthy. It continually shunts resources
away from long-term projects—such as building a strong immune system or
preserving a good mood—in favor of short-term crises. And this has lasting
consequences.

**Physical Consequences**

In our evolutionary past, when most people died by forty or so, the short-

term benefits of SNS/HPAA activation outweighed its long-term costs. But
for people today who are interested in living well during their forties and


-----

beyond, the accumulating damage of an overheated life is a real concern.
For example, chronic SNS/HPAA stimulation disturbs these systems and
increases risks for the health problems listed (Licinio, Gold, and Wong
1995; Sapolsky 1998; Wolf 1995):

**Gastrointestinal** —ulcers, colitis, irritable bowel syndrome,

diarrhea, and constipation
**Immune** —more frequent colds and flus, slower wound healing,
greater vulnerability to serious infections
**Cardiovascular** —hardening of the arteries, heart attacks
**Endocrine** —type II diabetes, premenstrual syndrome, erectile
dysfunction, lowered libido

**Mental Consequences**

For all their effects on the body, second darts usually have their greatest

impact on psychological well-being. Let’s see how they work in your brain
to raise anxiety and lower mood.

**ANXIETY**

Repeated SNS/HPAA activity makes the amygdala more reactive to

apparent threats, which in turn increases SNS/HPAA activation, which
sensitizes the amygdala further. The mental correlate of this physical
process is an increasingly rapid arousal of _state anxiety_ (anxiety based on
specific situations). Additionally, the amygdala helps form _implicit_
_memories_ (traces of past experiences that exist beneath conscious
awareness); as it becomes more sensitized, it increasingly shades those
residues with fear, thus intensifying _trait anxiety_ (ongoing anxiety
regardless of the situation).

Meanwhile, frequent SNS/HPAA activation wears down the

hippocampus, which is vital for forming _explicit memories_ —clear records
of what actually happened. Cortisol and related glucocorticoid hormones
both weaken existing synaptic connections in the hippocampus and inhibit
the formation of new ones. Further, the hippocampus is one of the few
regions in the human brain that can actually grow new neurons—yet


-----

glucocorticoids prevent the birth of neurons in the hippocampus, impairing
its ability to produce new memories.

It’s a bad combination for the amygdala to be oversensitized while the

hippocampus is compromised: painful experiences can then be recorded in
implicit memory—with all the distortions and turbo-charging of an
amygdala on overdrive—without an accurate explicit memory of them. This
might feel like: _Something happened, I’m not sure what, but I’m really_
_upset._ This may help explain why victims of trauma can feel dissociated
from the awful things they experienced, yet be very reactive to any trigger
that reminds them unconsciously of what once occurred. In less extreme
situations, the one-two punch of a revved-up amygdala and a weakened
hippocampus can lead to feeling a little upset a lot of the time without
exactly knowing why.

**DEPRESSED MOOD**

Routine SNS/HPAA activation undermines the biochemical basis of an

even-keeled—let alone cheerful—disposition in a number of ways:

Norepinephrine helps you feel alert and mentally energetic, but
glucocorticoid hormones deplete it. Reduced norepinephrine may
cause you to feel flat—even apathetic—with poor concentration;
these are classic symptoms of depression.
Over time, glucocorticoids lower the production of dopamine. This
leads to a loss of enjoyment of activities once found pleasurable:
another classic criterion for depression.
Stress reduces serotonin, probably the most important

neurotransmitter for maintaining a good mood. When serotonin
drops, so does norepinephrine, which has already been diminished
by glucocorticoids. In short, less serotonin means more vulnerability
to a blue mood and less alert interest in the world.

**An Intimate Process**

Of course, our experience of these physiological processes is very

intimate. When I’m upset, I sure don’t think about all of these biochemical


-----

details. But having a general idea of them in the back of my mind helps me
appreciate the sheer physicality of a second dart cascade, its impersonal
nature and dependence on preceding causes, and its impermanence.

This understanding is hopeful and motivating. Suffering has clear causes

in your brain and body, so if you change its causes, you’ll suffer a lot less.
And you _can_ change those causes. From this point on, we’re going to focus
on how to do just that.

## The Parasympathetic Nervous System

So far, we’ve examined how reactions powered by greed and hatred—
especially the latter—ripple through your brain and body, shaped by the
sympathetic nervous system. But the SNS is just one of the three wings of
the _autonomic nervous system_ (ANS), which operates mostly below the
level of consciousness to regulate many bodily systems and their responses
to changing conditions. The other two wings of the ANS are the
_parasympathetic nervous system_ (PNS) and the _enteric nervous system_
(which regulates your gastrointestinal system). Let’s focus on the PNS and
SNS as they play crucial roles in your suffering—and its end.

The PNS conserves energy in your body and is responsible for ongoing,

steady-state activity. It produces a feeling of relaxation, often with a sense
of contentment—this is why it’s sometimes called the “rest-and-digest”
system, in contrast to the “fight-or-flight” SNS. These two wings of the
ANS are connected like a seesaw: when one goes up, the other one goes
down.

Parasympathetic activation is the normal resting state of your body, brain,

and mind. If your SNS were surgically disconnected, you’d stay alive
(though you wouldn’t be very useful in an emergency). If your PNS were
disconnected, however, you’d stop breathing and soon die. Sympathetic
activation is a _change_ to the baseline of PNS equilibrium in order to
respond to a threat or an opportunity. The cooling, steadying influence of
the PNS helps you think clearly and avoid hot-headed actions that would
harm you or others. The PNS also quiets the mind and fosters tranquility,

## The Big Picture

The PNS and SNS evolved hand in hand in order to keep animals—
including humans—alive in potentially lethal environments. We need both
of them.

For example, take five breaths, inhaling and exhaling a little more fully

than usual. This is both energizing and relaxing, activating first the
sympathetic system and then the parasympathetic one, back and forth, in a
gentle rhythm. Notice how you feel when you’re done. That combination of
aliveness and centeredness is the essence of the peak performance zone
recognized by athletes, businesspeople, artists, lovers, and meditators. It’s
the result of the SNS and PNS, the gas pedal and the brakes, working in
harmony together.

Happiness, love, and wisdom aren’t furthered by shutting down the SNS,

but rather by keeping the autonomic nervous system as a whole in an
optimal state of balance:

Mainly parasympathetic arousal for a baseline of ease and
peacefulness
Mild SNS activation for enthusiasm, vitality, and wholesome
passions
Occasional SNS spikes to deal with demanding situations, from a
great opportunity at work to a late-night call from a teenager who
needs a ride home from a party gone bad

This is your best-odds prescription for a long, productive, happy life. Of

course, it takes practice.

## A Path of Practice

As the saying goes, pain is inevitable but suffering is optional. If you can
simply stay present with whatever is arising in awareness—whether it’s a
first dart or a second one—without reacting further, then you will break the
chain of suffering right there. Over time, through training and shaping your
mind and brain, you can even change what arises, increasing what’s positive


-----

and decreasing what’s negative. In the meantime, you can rest in and be
nourished by a growing sense of the peace and clarity in your true nature.

These three processes— _being with_ whatever arises, _working with_ the

tendencies of mind to transform them, and _taking refuge_ in the ground of
being—are the essential practices of the path of awakening. In many ways
they correspond, respectively, to mindfulness, virtue, and wisdom—and to
the three fundamental neural functions of learning, regulating, and
selecting.

As you deal with different issues on your path of awakening, you’ll

repeatedly encounter these stages of growth:

_Stage one_ —you’re caught in a second-dart reaction and don’t even
realize it: your partner forgets to bring milk home and you complain
angrily without seeing that your reaction is over the top.
_Stage two_ —you realize you’ve been hijacked by greed or hatred (in
the broadest sense), but cannot help yourself: internally you’re
squirming, but you can’t stop grumbling bitterly about the milk.
_Stage three_ —some aspect of the reaction arises, but you don’t act it
out: you feel irritated but remind yourself that your partner does a
lot for you already and getting cranky will just make things worse.
_Stage four_ —the reaction doesn’t even come up, and sometimes you
forget you ever had the issue: you understand that there’s no milk,
and you calmly figure out what to do now with your partner.

In education, these are known succinctly as unconscious incompetence,

conscious incompetence, conscious competence, and unconscious

competence. They’re useful labels for knowing where you are with a given
issue. The second stage is the hardest one, and often where we want to quit.
So it’s important to keep aiming for the third and fourth stages—just keep at
it and you’ll definitely get there!

It takes effort and time to clear old structures and build new ones. I call

this _the law of little things_ : although little moments of greed, hatred, and
delusion have left residues of suffering in your mind and brain, lots of little
moments of practice will replace these Three Poisons and the suffering they
cause with happiness, love, and wisdom.


-----

We’ve covered a lot of ground and have seen a lot about the evolutionary

origins and neural causes of suffering. Now, in the rest of this book, let’s
see how to end it.

## chapter 3: Key Points

Some physical and mental discomforts are unavoidable. These are
the “first darts” of life.
When we react to a first dart with one or more of the Three Poisons
of greed, hatred, and delusion (broadly defined)—each one of which
has craving at its center—we start throwing second darts at
ourselves and others. In fact, we often toss second darts even when
no first dart is to be found. Most poignantly, we sometimes throw
second darts as a reaction to situations that are actually good, such
as receiving a compliment.
Suffering is deeply embodied. Physical reactions involving your
sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis (HPAA) cause suffering to snowball throughout your
body.
Most people experience chronic second-dart cascades, with
numerous negative consequences for their physical and mental
health.
The rest-and-digest parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) calms
down SNS/HPAA activation.
The best-odds prescription for a long, good life is a baseline of
mainly PNS arousal with mild SNS activation for vitality, combined
with occasional SNS spikes for major opportunities or threats.
Being with whatever arises, working with the tendencies of mind to
transform them, and taking refuge in the ground of being are the
essential practices of the path of awakening. In many ways, these
practices correspond, respectively, to mindfulness, virtue, and
wisdom.
On the path of awakening, keep going! Lots of little moments of
practice will gradually and truly increase your contentment,
kindness, and insight.

# Taking in the Good

_I am larger, better than I thought, I did not know I held so much_

_goodness._

—Walt Whitman, “Song of the Open Road”

Much as your body is built from the foods you eat, your mind is built from
the experiences you have. The flow of experience gradually sculpts your
brain, thus shaping your mind. Some of the results can be explicitly
recalled: _This is what I did last summer; that is how I felt when I was in_
_love._ But most of the shaping of your mind remains forever unconscious.
This is called implicit memory, and it includes your expectations, models of
relationships, emotional tendencies, and general outlook. Implicit memory
establishes the interior landscape of your mind—what it feels like to be you
—based on the slowly accumulating residues of lived experience.

In a sense, those residues can be sorted into two piles: those that benefit

you and others, and those that cause harm. To paraphrase the Wise Effort
section of Buddhism’s Noble Eightfold Path, you should create, preserve,
and increase beneficial implicit memories, and prevent, eliminate, or
decrease harmful ones.

## The Negativity Bias of Memory

But here’s the problem: your brain preferentially scans for, registers, stores,
recalls, and reacts to unpleasant experiences; as we’ve said, it’s like Velcro
for negative experiences and Teflon for positive ones. Consequently, even
when positive experiences outnumber negative ones, the pile of negative
implicit memories naturally grows faster. Then the background feeling of
what it feels like to be you can become undeservedly glum and pessimistic.


-----

Sure, negative experiences do have benefits: loss opens the heart,

remorse provides a moral compass, anxiety alerts you to threats, and anger
spotlights wrongs that should be righted. But do you really think you’re not
having enough negative experiences?! Emotional pain with no benefit to
yourself or others is pointless suffering. And pain today breeds more pain
tomorrow. For instance, even a single episode of major depression can
reshape circuits of the brain to make future episodes more likely (Maletic et
al. 2007).

The remedy is not to suppress negative experiences; when they happen,

they happen. Rather, it is to foster positive experiences—and in particular,
to take them in so they become a permanent part of you.

## Internalizing the Positive

Here’s how, in three steps:

1. Turn positive facts into positive _experiences_ . Good things keep

happening all around us, but much of the time we don’t notice them;
even when we do, we often hardly feel them. Someone is nice to
you, you see an admirable quality in yourself, a flower is blooming,
you finish a difficult project—and it all just rolls by. Instead,
actively look for good news, particularly the little stuff of daily life:
the faces of children, the smell of an orange, a memory from a
happy vacation, a minor success at work, and so on. Whatever
positive facts you find, bring a mindful awareness to them—open up
to them and let them affect you. It’s like sitting down to a banquet:
don’t just look at it—dig in!

2. Savor the experience. It’s delicious! Make it last by staying with it

for 5, 10, even 20 seconds; don’t let your attention skitter off to
something else. The longer that something is held in awareness and
the more emotionally stimulating it is, the more neurons that fire
and thus wire together, and the stronger the trace in memory (Lewis
2005).

Focus on your emotions and body sensations, since these are the

essence of implicit memory. Let the experience fill your body and
be as intense as possible. For example, if someone is good to you,


-----

let the feeling of being cared about bring warmth to your whole
chest.

Pay particular attention to the rewarding aspects of the experience—

for example, how good it feels to get a great big hug from someone
you love. Focusing on these rewards increases dopamine release,
which makes it easier to keep giving the experience your attention,
and strengthens its neural associations in implicit memory. You’re
not doing this to cling to the rewards—which would eventually
make you suffer—but rather to internalize them so that you carry
them inside you and don’t need to reach for them in the outer world.

You can also intensify an experience by deliberately enriching it. For

example, if you are savoring a relationship experience, you could
call up other feelings of being loved by others, which will help
stimulate oxytocin—the “bonding hormone”—and thus deepen your
sense of connection. Or you could strengthen your feelings of
satisfaction after completing a demanding project by thinking about
some of the challenges you had to overcome.

3. Imagine or feel that the experience is entering deeply into your mind

and body, like the sun’s warmth into a T-shirt, water into a sponge,
or a jewel placed in a treasure chest in your heart. Keep relaxing
your body and absorbing the emotions, sensations, and thoughts of
the experience.

## Healing Pain

Positive experiences can also be used to soothe, balance, and even replace
negative ones. When two things are held in mind at the same time, they
start to connect with each other. That’s one reason why talking about hard
things with someone who’s supportive can be so healing: painful feelings
and memories get infused with the comfort, encouragement, and closeness
you experience with the other person.

**Using the Machinery of Memory**


-----

These mental minglings draw on the neural machinery of memory. When

a memory—whether implicit or explicit—is made, only its key features are
stored, not every single detail. Otherwise, your brain would become so
crowded that it wouldn’t have space to learn anything new. For example,
remember an experience, even a recent one, and notice how schematic your
recollection is, with the main features sketched in but many details left out.

When your brain retrieves a memory, it does not do it like a computer

does, which calls up a complete record of what’s on its hard drive (e.g.,
document, picture, song). Your brain rebuilds implicit and explicit
memories from their key features, drawing on its simulating capacities to
fill in missing details. While this is more work, it’s also a more efficient use
of neural real estate—this way complete records don’t need to be stored.
And your brain is so fast that you don’t notice the regeneration of each
memory.

This rebuilding process gives you the opportunity, right down in the

micro-circuitry of your brain, to gradually shift the emotional shadings of
your interior landscape. When a memory is activated, a large-scale
assembly of neurons and synapses forms an emergent pattern. If other
things are in your mind at the same time—and particularly if they’re
strongly pleasant or unpleasant—your amygdala and hippocampus will
automatically associate them with that neural pattern (Pare, Collins, and
Pelletier 2002). Then, when the memory leaves awareness, it will be
reconsolidated in storage _along with those other associations._

The next time the memory is activated, it will tend to bring those

associations with it. Thus, if you repeatedly bring to mind negative feelings
and thoughts while a memory is active, then that memory will be
increasingly shaded in a negative direction. For example, recalling an old
failure while simultaneously lambasting yourself will make that failure
seem increasingly awful. On the other hand, if you call up positive
emotions and perspectives while implicit or explicit memories are active,
these wholesome influences will slowly be woven into the fabric of those
memories.

Every time you do this—every time you sift positive feelings and views

into painful, limiting states of mind—you build a little bit of neural
structure. Over time, the accumulating impact of this positive material will
literally, synapse by synapse, change your brain.


-----

## Lifelong Learning

Neural circuits started forming before you were born, and your brain
will keep learning and changing up to your very last breath.
Humans have the longest childhood of any animal on the planet.
Since children are very vulnerable in the wild, there must have been
a large evolutionary payoff in giving the brain an extended period of
intense development. Of course, learning continues after childhood;
we continually acquire new skills and knowledge all the way into
old age. (After he turned 90, my dad made my jaw drop with an
article in which he calculated the best odds for different bids in
bridge; there are lots of similar examples.)
The brain’s capacity to learn—and thus change itself—is called
_neuroplasticity_ . Usually, the results are tiny, incremental alternations
in neural structure that add up as the years go by. Occasionally, the
results are dramatic—for example, in blind people, some occipital
regions designed for visual processing can be rezoned for auditory
functions (Begley 2007).
Mental activity shapes neural structure in a variety of ways:

Neurons that are particularly active become even more
responsive to input.
Busy neural networks receive increased blood flow, which
supplies them with more glucose and oxygen.
When neurons fire together—within a few milliseconds of
each other—they strengthen their existing synapses and form
new ones; this is how they “wire” together (Tanaka et al.
2008).
Inactive synapses wither away through _neuronal pruning_ , a
kind of survival of the busiest: use it or lose it. A toddler has
about three times as many synapses as an adult; on the way
to adulthood, adolescents can lose up to 10,000 synapses per
second in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Spear 2000).
Brand new neurons grow in the hippocampus; this
_neurogenesis_ increases the openness of memory networks to
new learning (Gould et al. 1999).

Emotional arousal facilitates learning by increasing neural excitation
and consolidating synaptic change (Lewis 2005).


-----

Because of all the ways your brain changes its structure, your experience

_matters_ beyond its momentary, subjective impact. It makes enduring
changes in the physical tissues of your brain which affect your well-being,
functioning, and relationships. Based on science, this is a fundamental
reason for being kind to yourself, cultivating wholesome experiences, and
taking them in.

**Pulling Weeds and Planting Flowers**

To gradually replace negative implicit memories with positive ones, just

make the positive aspects of your experience prominent and relatively
intense in the foreground of your awareness while simultaneously placing
the negative material in the background. Imagine that the positive contents
of your awareness are sinking down into old wounds, soothing chafed and
bruised places like a warm golden salve, filling up hollows, slowly
replacing negative feelings and beliefs with positive ones.

The negative mental material you’re working with could be from

adulthood, including current experiences. But it’s often important to address
explicit and implicit memories from your childhood, since these are usually
the taproots of the things that keep upsetting you. People sometimes get
angry with themselves about still being affected by things from the past.
But remember: the brain is designed to change through experiences,
especially negative ones; we learn from our experiences, particularly those
that happened during childhood, and it is natural for that learning to stick
with us.

Growing up, I used to weed dandelions in our front yard, and they’d

always grow back if I didn’t pull out their entire root. Upsets are like that,
too. So sense down into the youngest, most vulnerable, most emotionally
charged layers of your mind, and feel around for the tip of the root of
whatever is bothering you. With a little practice and self-understanding,
you’ll develop a short list of “usual suspects”—the deep sources of your
recurring upsets—and you’ll start routinely considering them if you feel
irritated, anxious, hurt, or inadequate. These deep sources might include
feeling unwanted by others due to being unpopular in school, a sense of
helplessness from a chronic illness, or mistrust of intimacy following a bad
divorce. When you find the tip of the root, take in the good that will


-----

gradually dislodge its hold upon you. You’ll be pulling weeds and planting
flowers in the garden of your mind.

Painful experiences are often best healed by positive ones that are their

opposite—for example, replacing childhood feelings of being weak with a
current sense of strength. If sadness from mistreatment in an old
relationship keeps coming up, recall being loved by other people, and let
those feelings sink in. Add the power of language by saying something like
this to yourself: _I got through all that, I’m still here, and many people love_
_me._ You won’t forget what happened, but its emotional charge will steadily
diminish.

The point is not to resist painful experiences or grasp at pleasant ones:

that’s a kind of craving—and craving leads to suffering. The art is to find a
balance in which you remain mindful, accepting, and curious regarding
difficult experiences—while also taking in supportive feelings and
thoughts.

In sum, infuse positive material into negative material in these two ways:

When you have a positive experience today, help it sink in to old
pains.
When negative material arises, bring to mind the positive emotions
and perspectives that will be its antidote.

Whenever you use one of these methods, try to feel and take in related

positive experiences at least a couple more times within the following hour.
There’s evidence that negative memory—both explicit and implicit—is
especially vulnerable to change soon after it’s been recalled (Monfils et al.
2009).

If you’re feeling ambitious, do something additional: take small risks and

do things that reason tells you are fine but worry wants you to avoid—such
as being more open about your true feelings, asking directly for love, or
reaching higher in your career. When the results turn out to be good—as
they most likely will—take them in and slowly but surely clear out those
old fears.

Most of the time, taking in the good takes less than a minute—often, just

a few seconds. It’s a private act. No one needs to know you’re doing it. But
over time, you really can build new, positive structures in your brain.


-----

## Why It’s Good to Take in the Good

Given the negativity bias of the brain, it takes an _active_ effort to internalize
positive experiences and heal negative ones. When you tilt toward what’s
positive, you’re actually righting a neurological imbalance. And you’re
giving yourself today the caring and encouragement you should have
received as a child, but perhaps didn’t get in full measure.

Focusing on what is wholesome and then taking it in naturally increases

the positive emotions flowing through your mind each day. Emotions have
global effects since they organize the brain as a whole. Consequently,
positive feelings have far-reaching benefits, including a stronger immune
system (Frederickson 2000) and a cardiovascular system that is less reactive
to stress (Frederickson and Levenson 1998). They lift your mood; increase
optimism, resilience, and resourcefulness; and help counteract the effects of
painful experiences, including trauma (Frederickson 2001; Frederickson et
al. 2000). It’s a positive cycle: good feelings today increase the likelihood
of good feelings tomorrow.

These benefits apply to children as well. In particular, taking in the good

has a special payoff for kids at either the spirited or the anxious end of the
temperament spectrum. Spirited children usually zip along to the next thing
before good feelings have a chance to consolidate in the brain, and anxious
children tend to ignore or downplay good news. (And some kids are both
spirited and anxious.) Whatever their temperament, if children are part of
your life, encourage them to pause for a moment at the end of the day (or at
any other natural interval, such as the last minute before the school bell) to
remember what went well and think about things that make them happy
(e.g., a pet, their parents’ love, a goal scored in soccer). Then have those
positive feelings and thoughts sink in.

In terms of spiritual practice, taking in the good highlights key states of

mind, such as kindness and inner peace, so you can find your way back to
them again. It is rewarding, and this helps keep you on the path of
awakening, which does sometimes feel like an uphill slog. It builds
conviction and faith by showing you the results of your efforts. It nourishes
wholeheartedness through its emphasis on positive, heartfelt emotions—and
when your own heart is full, you have more to offer to others.


-----

Taking in the good is not about putting a happy shiny face on everything,

nor is it about turning away from the hard things in life. It’s about
nourishing well-being, contentment, and peace inside that are refuges you
can always come from and return to.

## chapter 4: Key Points

Explicit memories are conscious recollections of specific events or
other information. Implicit memories are residues of past
experiences that largely remain below awareness but powerfully
shape the inner landscape and atmosphere of your mind.
Unfortunately, the bias of the brain tilts implicit memories in a
negative direction, even when most of your experiences are actually
positive.
The first remedy is to consciously look for and take in positive
experiences. There are three simple steps: turn positive facts into
positive experiences, savor these experiences, and sense them
sinking in.
When experiences are consolidated in memory, they take with them
whatever else is also in awareness, especially if it is intense. You
can use this mechanism to infuse positive material into negative
material; this is the second remedy. Simply have a positive
experience be prominent in awareness while the painful one is
sensed dimly in the background. Use this method in two ways: when
you have a positive experience, help it sink into, soothe, and replace
old pains; when negative material arises, bring to mind emotions
and perspectives that are its antidote.
Become aware of the deep roots of recurring upsets; the tips of these
roots are typically lodged in childhood experiences; different upsets
may have different roots. Deliberately direct positive experiences
toward these roots in order to pull them out completely and stop
them from growing back.
Every time you take in the good, you build a little bit of neural
structure. Doing this a few times a day—for months and even years
—will gradually change your brain, and how you feel and act, in farreaching ways.


-----

It’s good to take in the good. It builds up positive emotions, with
many benefits for your physical and mental health. It’s a great
resource for children, especially spirited or anxious ones. And it aids
spiritual practice by supporting motivation, conviction, and
wholeheartedness.

# Cooling the Fires

_Indeed, the sage who’s fully quenched_

_Rests at ease in every way;_

_No sense desire adheres to him_

_Whose fires have cooled, deprived of fuel._

_All attachments have been severed,_

_The heart’s been led away from pain;_

_Tranquil, he rests with utmost ease._

_The mind has found its way to peace._

The Buddha (Cullavagga 6:4.4)

As we’ve seen, your sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and stress-related
hormones “fire up” to help you pursue opportunities and avoid threats.
While there’s certainly a place for healthy passion and for strong stands
against things that are harmful, most of the time we’re just overheated—
caught up with some carrot or struggling with some stick. Then we feel
driven, rattled, stressed, irritated, anxious, or blue. Definitely not happy. We
need to lower the flames. This chapter will cover many ways to do just that.

If your body had a fire department, it would be the parasympathetic

nervous system (PNS), so that’s where we’ll start.

## Activating the Parasympathetic Nervous System

Your body has numerous major systems, including the endocrine
(hormone), cardiovascular, immune, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems.
If you want to use the mind-body connection to lower your stress, cool the
fires, and improve your long-term health, what’s the optimal point of entry
into all of these systems? It’s the autonomic nervous system (ANS).


-----

This is because the ANS—which is part of the larger nervous system—is

intertwined with and helps regulate every other system. And mental activity
has greater direct influence over the ANS than any other bodily system.
When you stimulate the parasympathetic wing of the ANS, calming,
soothing, healing ripples spread through your body, brain, and mind.

Let’s explore a variety of ways to light up the PNS.

**Relaxation**

Relaxing engages the circuitry of the PNS and thus strengthens it.

Relaxing also quiets the fight-or-flight sympathetic nervous system, since
relaxed muscles send feedback to the alarm centers in the brain that all is
well. When you’re very relaxed, it’s hard to feel stressed or upset (Benson
2000). In fact, the relaxation response may actually alter how your genes
are expressed, and thus reduce the cellular damage of chronic stress (Dusek
et al. 2008).

You can reap the benefits of relaxation not only by initiating it in

specific, stressful situations, but also by training your body “offline” to
relax automatically; the methods that follow can be used in either way.
First, here are four quick ones:

Relax your tongue, eyes, and jaw muscles.
Feel tension draining out of your body and sinking down into the
earth.
Run warm water over your hands.
Scan your body for areas that are tense, and relax them.

**DIAPHRAGM BREATHING**

The next method—diaphragm breathing—takes a minute or two. The

diaphragm is the muscle beneath your lungs that helps you breathe; actively
working it is particularly effective for reducing anxiety.

Place your hand on your stomach a couple of inches beneath the upside-

down V at the center of your rib cage. Look down, breathe normally, and
watch your hand. You’ll probably see it move only a little bit, and sort of up
and down.


-----

Leaving your hand in place, now breathe in such a way that your hand

moves out and back, perpendicular to your chest. Try to breathe into your
hand with real oomph, so that it travels back and forth half an inch or more
with each breath.

This can take some practice, but keep at it and you’ll get it. Next, try

diaphragm breathing without your hand so you can use this method, if you
like, in public settings.

**PROGRESSIVE RELAXATION**

If you have three to ten minutes, try progressive relaxation, in which you

focus systematically on different parts of your body, working either from
the feet to the head or vice versa. Depending on how much time you have,
you might focus on large sections of your body—e.g., left leg, right leg—or
on much smaller units, such as left foot, right foot, left ankle, right ankle,
and so on. You can do progressive relaxation with your eyes open or closed,
but learning to do it with your eyes open will help you relax more deeply if
you’re with other people.

In order to relax a part of your body, simply bring it into awareness; for

example, take a moment right now to notice the sensations in the bottom of
your left foot. Or say “relax” softly in your mind as you bring awareness to
a body part. Or locate a point or a space in that part. Whatever works best.

For many people, progressive relaxation is also a great method for falling

asleep.

**Big Exhalation**

Inhale as much as you can, hold that inhalation for a few seconds, and

then exhale slowly while relaxing. A big inhalation really expands your
lungs, requiring a big exhalation to bring the lungs back to their resting size.
This stimulates the PNS, which is in charge of exhaling.

**Touching the Lips**


-----

Parasympathetic fibers are spread throughout your lips; thus, touching

your lips stimulates the PNS. Touching your lips can also bring up soothing
associations of eating or even of breastfeeding when you were a baby.

**Mindfulness of the Body**

Since your PNS is primarily directed at maintaining the internal

equilibrium of your body, bringing attention inward activates

parasympathetic networks (as long as you’re not worried about your
health). You may have already had some practice with mindfulness of the
body (e.g., yoga, a stress-management class). Mindfulness just means being
fully aware of something, in the moment with it, and not judging or
resisting it. Be attentive to physical sensations; that’s all there is to it.

For example, notice the sensations of breathing, the cool air coming in

and the warm air going out, the chest and belly rising and falling. Or the
sensations of walking, reaching, or swallowing. Following even a single
breath from beginning to end—or a single step on the way to work—can be
remarkably centering and calming.

**Imagery**

Although mental activity is commonly equated with verbal thought, most

of the brain is actually devoted to nonverbal activities, such as processing
mental pictures. Imagery activates the right hemisphere of the brain and
quiets internal verbal chatter that could be stressful.

Like relaxation, you can use imagery on the spot to stimulate the PNS, or

do longer visualizations when you’ve got the time to develop imagery that
will be a powerful anchor for well-being. For example, if you’re feeling
stressed while at work, you could bring to mind a peaceful mountain lake
for a few seconds. Then, when you have more time at home, you might
visualize walking around the lake, and enrich your mental movie with the
good smells of pine needles or the sound of children laughing.

**Balance Your Heartbeat**


-----

A regular heart rate has small changes in the interval between each beat;

this is called _heart rate variability_ (HRV). For example, if your heart beat
sixty times in a minute, the time between beats would average one second.
But your heart is not a mechanical metronome, and the interval between
beats is continually changing: it could be something like 1 sec., 1.05 sec.,
1.1 sec., 1.15 sec., 1.1 sec., 1.05 sec., 1 sec., .95 sec., .9 sec., .85 sec., .9
sec., .95 sec., 1 sec., and so on.

HRV reflects the activity of the autonomic nervous system. For example,

your heart speeds up a little when you inhale (SNS activation) and slows
down when you exhale (PNS arousal). Stress, negative emotions, and aging
all decrease HRV, and people with relatively low HRV are less likely to
recover after a heart attack (Kristal-Boneh, et al. 1995).

An interesting question is whether heart rate variability is merely an

_effect_ of ups and downs in stress and other factors, or whether changes in
HRV can themselves directly _cause_ improvements in mental and physical
health. The evidence is preliminary, but studies have shown that learning to
increase the amount and coherence of HRV is associated with decreased
stress, and improved cardiovascular health, immune system function, and
mood (Luskin, et al. 2002; McCraty, Atkinson, and Thomasino 2003).

HRV is a good indicator of parasympathetic arousal and overall well-

being, and you can change it directly. The HeartMath Institute has
pioneered the study of HRV and developed numerous techniques, which
we’ve adapted for this simple, three-part approach:

1. Breathe in such a way that your inhalation and exhalation are the

same duration; for example, count one, two, three, four in your mind
while inhaling, and one, two, three, four while exhaling.

2. At the same time, imagine or sense that you’re breathing in and out

through the area of your heart.

3. As you breathe evenly through your heart, call to mind a pleasant,

heartfelt emotion such as gratitude, kindness, or love—perhaps by
thinking about a happy time, being with your children, appreciation
for the good things in your life, or a pet. You can also imagine this
feeling moving through your heart as part of the breath.

Try this for a minute or longer—you’ll probably be quite struck by the

**Meditation**

Meditation activates the PNS through multiple pathways. These include

withdrawing attention from stressful matters, relaxing, and bringing
awareness into the body. Through stimulating the PNS and other parts of
the nervous system, regular meditation:

Increases gray matter in the insula (Hölzel et al. 2008; Lazar et al.
2005), hippocampus (Hölzel et al. 2008; Luders et al. 2009), and
prefrontal cortex (Lazar et al. 2005; Luders et al. 2009); reduces
cortical thinning due to aging in prefrontal regions strengthened by
meditation (Lazar et al. 2008); improves psychological functions
associated with these regions, including attention (Carter et al. 2005;
Tang et al. 2007), compassion (Lutz, Brefczynski-Lewis et al. 2008),
and empathy (Lazar et al. 2005)
Increases activation of left frontal regions, which lifts mood
(Davidson 2004)
Increases the power and reach of fast, gamma-range brainwaves in
experienced Tibetan practitioners (Lutz et al. 2004); brainwaves are
the weak but measurable electrical waves produced by large
numbers of neurons firing rhythmically together
Decreases stress-related cortisol (Tang et al. 2007)
Strengthens the immune system (Davidson et al. 2003; Tang et al.
2007)
Helps a variety of medical conditions, including cardiovascular
disease, asthma, type II diabetes, PMS, and chronic pain (Walsh and
Shapiro 2006)
Helps numerous psychological conditions, including insomnia,
anxiety, phobias, and eating disorders (Walsh and Shapiro 2006)

There are many contemplative traditions and many ways to meditate, and

you may already have your own favorite method. The following box
describes a basic mindfulness meditation. The key to reaping the rewards of
meditation is to develop a regular, daily practice, no matter how brief. How
about making a personal commitment never to go to sleep without having
meditated that day, even if for just one minute? Also consider joining a
regular meditation group in your area.

## Mindfulness Meditation

Find a comfortable place where you can focus and you won’t be disturbed.
It’s fine to meditate while standing, walking, or lying down, but most
people do so while sitting on a chair or cushion. Find a posture that is both
relaxed and alert, with your spine reasonably straight. As the Zen saying
suggests, you should handle your mind like the skillful rider of a horse, with
neither too tight nor too loose a rein.

Meditate for as long as you like. You can start with shorter periods, even

just five minutes. Longer sittings, from thirty to sixty minutes, will usually
help you go deeper. You can decide how long you’re going to meditate at
the outset or play it by ear. It’s all right to glance at a clock during the
meditation. Alternately, you could set a timer. Some people light a stick of
incense—when it’s finished, they are, too. Feel free to modify the
suggestions that follow.

_Take a big breath and relax, with your eyes open or closed. Be aware of_
_sounds coming and going, and let them be whatever they are. Know that_
_you are taking this time to meditate. You can drop all other concerns during_
_this period, like setting down a heavy bag before plopping into a_
_comfortable chair. After the meditation, you can pick those concerns up_
_again—if you want to!_

_Bring your awareness to the sensations of breathing. Don’t try to control_

_the breath; let it be whatever it is. Sense the cool air coming in and warm_
_air going out. The chest and belly rising and falling._

_Try to stay with the sensations of each breath from beginning to end. You_

_may want to softly count your breaths—count to ten and then start over; go_
_back to one if your mind wanders—or note them quietly to yourself as “in”_
_and “out.” It’s normal for the mind to wander, and when it does, just return_
_to the breath. Be gentle and kind with yourself. See if you can stay attentive_
_to ten breaths in a row (usually a challenge at first). After your mind settles_
_down during the first minutes of the meditation, explore becoming_
_increasingly absorbed in the breath and letting go of everything else. Open_
_to the simple pleasures of breathing, given over to the breath. With some_
_practice, see if you can stay present with the breath for dozens of breaths in_
_a row._


-----

_Using the breath as a kind of anchor, be aware of whatever else is_

_moving through the mind. Aware of thoughts and feelings, wishes and plans,_
_images and memories—all coming and going. Let them be what they are;_
_don’t get caught up in them; don’t struggle with or get fascinated by them._
_Have a sense of acceptance—even kindness—toward whatever passes_
_through the open space of awareness._

_Keep settling into the breath, perhaps with a growing sense of_

_peacefulness. Be aware of the changing nature of what passes through the_
_mind. Notice how it feels to get caught up in the passing contents of_
_awareness—and how it feels to let them go by. Be aware of peaceful,_
_spacious awareness itself._

_When you like, bring the meditation to an end. Notice how you feel, and_

_take in the good of your meditation._

## Feeling Safer

As we saw in chapter 2, the brain continually scans your inner and outer
worlds for threats. When any are detected, your stress-response system fires
up.

Occasionally, this vigilance is warranted, but usually it’s excessive,

driven by amygdala-hippocampus reactions to past events that are no longer
likely. The anxiety that results is unnecessary and unpleasant, and it primes
your brain and body to overreact to small things.

Additionally, vigilance and anxiety draw attention away from

mindfulness and contemplative absorption. It’s no accident that traditional
instructions for meditation often encourage practitioners to find a place of
seclusion where they are protected from harm. For example, the account of
the Buddha’s night of awakening has him sitting at the base of the Bodhi
Tree, which “had his back.” Feelings of safety tell the brain that it can
afford to bring in the troops that have been manning the watchtowers, and
put them to work internally to increase concentration and insight—or just
let them get some rest.

But before we explore specific methods for feeling safer, two important

points. First, in ordinary reality, there is no such thing as complete safety.
Life is continually changing, cars run red lights, people get sick, and whole


-----

nations erupt and send shock waves around the world. There is no
absolutely stable ground, no perfect shelter. Accepting this truth is wisdom,
and embracing it and getting on with life can feel exhilarating. Second, for
some people—especially those with a history of trauma—reducing anxiety
can seem threatening, since lowering their guard makes them feel
vulnerable. For these reasons, we speak of “safer” rather than “safe,” and
please adapt the methods that follow to your own needs.

**Relax Your Body**

Relaxation drains away anxiety like pulling the plug in a bathtub. (See

the methods described earlier in this chapter.)

**Use Imagery**

Right hemisphere imagery is closely connected with emotional

processing. To feel safer, visualize protective figures with you, such as a
beloved grandmother or a guardian angel. Or imagine that you’re
surrounded by a bubble of light like a force field; in ticklish situations, I’ll
sometimes hear Captain Kirk’s voice (from _Star Trek_ ) in my mind: “Shields
up, Scotty!”

**Connect with People Who Support You**

Identify friends and family who care about you, and try to spend more

time with them. When you’re apart, visualize being with them and take in
the good feelings. Companionship, even if only imagined, activates the
brain’s attachment and social group circuitry. Physical and emotional
closeness to caregivers and other members of the band was a necessity for
survival during our evolutionary history. Consequently, activating a felt
sense of closeness will probably help you feel safer.

**Bring Mindfulness to Fear**


-----

Anxiety, dread, apprehension, worry, and even panic are just mental

states like any other. Recognize fear when it arises, observe the feeling of it
in your body, watch it try to convince you that you should be alarmed, see it
change and move on. Verbally describe to yourself what you’re feeling, to
increase frontal lobe regulation of the limbic system (Hariri, Bookheimer,
and Mazziotta 2000; Lieberman et al. 2007). Notice how the awareness
which contains fear is itself never fearful. Keep separating from the fear;
settle back into the vast space of awareness through which fear passes like a
cloud.

**Evoke Inner Protectors**

Enabled by the distributed network of the nervous system, different

subpersonalities interact dynamically to form the seemingly monolithic but
actually fragmented self. For example, one well-known threesome is called
the inner child/critical parent/nurturing parent; a related triad is the
victim/persecutor/protector. Your nurturing parent/protector subpersonality
is reassuring, encouraging, and soothing, and it stands up against the inner
and outer voices that are judgmental and demeaning. It does _not_ flatter you
or make things up. It is grounded in reality, like a solid, caring, no-nonsense
teacher or coach who reminds you of good things about you and the world
while telling mean people to back off and leave you alone.

Growing up, many of us felt let down by people who should have been

better protectors. The deepest upsets are often not with those who harmed
you but with the people who didn’t prevent it—they’re the ones you
probably had the strongest attachment bonds to and thus felt most let down
by. So it’s understandable if your inner protector is not as strong as it could
be. What you can do today is pay particular attention to the experience of
being with strong people who care for you and stand up for you; savor this
experience and take it in. Imagine, and perhaps write down, a conversation
between an inner protector and a critical or alarming subpersonality, and
make sure that the inner protector makes a powerful case for you.

**Be Realistic**


-----

Draw on prefrontal capacities to evaluate: What is the chance that the

feared event will happen? How bad would it be? How long would the
damage last? What could I do to cope? Who could help me?

Most fears are exaggerated. As you go through life, your brain acquires

expectations based on your experiences, particularly negative ones. When
situations occur that are even remotely similar, your brain automatically
applies its expectations to them; if it expects pain or loss, or even just the
threat of these, it pulses fear signals. But because of the negativity bias,
many expectations of pain or loss are overstated or completely unfounded.

For example, I was a shy child and considerably younger than most of

the other kids in my classrooms, so I grew up feeling like an outsider, and a
lonely one, in many situations. Later, as an adult, when I joined a new
group (e.g., a team at work, the board of a nonprofit), I’d anticipate being
an outsider again, and feel uncomfortable about it—even though the other
people in the group were perfectly welcoming.

Expectations that come from childhood—often the most powerful ones of

all—are particularly suspect. When you’re young, (A) you have little choice
about your family, school, and peers, (B) your parents and many others
have much more power than you do, and (C) you don’t have many
resources yourself. But these days, the plain facts are that (A) you have
many more choices about what you do in life, (B) power differentials
between you and others are usually minimal or nonexistent, and (C) you
have lots of inner and outer resources (e.g., coping skills, goodwill toward
you from others). So, when a fear arises, ask yourself: “What options do I
actually have? How could I exercise power skillfully to stick up for myself
and take good care of myself? What resources could I draw upon?”

You’re trying to see the world clearly, without distortion, confusion, or

selective attention. What are the facts? Science, business, medicine,
psychology, and contemplative practice are all founded on the truth of
things, whatever it may be; in Buddhism, for example, ignorance is
considered the fundamental source of suffering. Not surprisingly, studies
have shown that appraising a situation more accurately leads to greater
positive emotions and fewer negative ones (Gross and John 2003). And if
there really is something to worry about, deal with it as best you can (e.g.,
pay the bill, see the doctor). Not only will doing _something_ and moving


-----

forward feel better in its own right, it will also usually improve a situation
that’s worrying you (Aspinwall and Taylor 1997).

**Nurture Your Sense of Secure Attachment**

Your childhood relationships with major caregivers—notably your

parents—have probably had a great influence on your expectations,
attitudes, emotions, and actions in your important relationships as an adult.
Dan Siegel (2001, 2007), Allan Schore (2003), Mary Main (Main, Hesse,
and Kaplan 2005), and others have helped clarify the neurobiology of
attachment. To summarize a large body of research, the recurring
experiences a young child has with her parents—which are affected by the
child’s temperament—will lead to one of four modes of _attachment_ to them:
_secure_ , _insecure-avoidant_ , _insecure-anxious_ , and _disorganized_ (this last type
is rare and won’t be discussed further). The type of attachment to one parent
is largely independent of the type of attachment to the other one. Insecure
attachment modes appear to be associated with characteristic patterns of
neural activity, such as a lack of integration between the prefrontal cortex
(PFC) and the limbic system (Siegel 2001).

Attachment modes tend to persist into adulthood and become the

underlying, default template for important relationships. If, like a large
fraction of the population, you grew up with insecure-avoidant or insecureanxious attachment, you can still change that template so you experience a
greater sense of security in your relationships. Here are some good methods
for doing so:

Develop self-understanding of how your upbringing affected your
relationships with your parents, especially in early childhood;
acknowledge any insecure attachment.
Bring compassion to yourself for any sense of insecurity.
As much as possible, seek out nurturing and reliable people, and
take in the feeling of being with them. Also do what you can to be
treated well in your existing relationships.
Practice mindfulness of your inner state, including through
meditation. In effect, you are giving yourself today the attention and
attunement you should have received as a child. Mindfulness


-----

activates the mid-line regions of your brain and helps increase the
coordination between the PFC and the limbic system; these are key
neural substrates of secure attachment (Siegel 2007).

## Finding Refuge

In this life, where have you found refuge? Refuges include people, places,
memories, ideas, and ideals—anyone or anything that provides reliable
sanctuary and protection, so you can let down your guard and gather
strength and wisdom. As a child, refuge might have been your mother’s lap,
reading in bed, or hanging out with friends. Personally, I spent a lot of time
in the hills around my home, clearing my head and getting refueled by
nature.

Today as an adult, your refuge might be a particular location or activity

(e.g., a church or temple, a quiet walk with your dog, a long bath) or the
company of your mate, good friends, or perhaps a teacher. Some refuges are
ineffable, though potentially more profound: confidence in the power of
reason, feeling connected with nature, or a basic intuition of the
fundamental alrightness of all things.

Consider these refuges, adapted from Buddhism with some broadened

meanings:

Teacher—the historical figure at the center of a faith tradition (such
as Jesus, Moses, Siddhartha, or Mohammed) in whom one has
confidence; qualities embodied by that person which are also
present within you
Truth—reality itself and accurate descriptions of it (e.g., how
suffering arises and ends)
Good company—both those who are farther along on the path of
awakening and those joined with you in fellowship near at hand

Taking refuge pulls you away from reactivating situations and concerns,

and then fills you with positive influences. As you rest increasingly in a
background sense of refuge, neurons are quietly stitching a safety net for
you. On the path of awakening, it’s natural to experience some upheaval,
dark nights of the soul, or unnerving groundlessness when the foundation of


-----

old beliefs falls away. At these times, your refuges will catch you and help
you ride out the storm.

Try to take refuge in one or more things every day. This can be formal or

informal, verbal or nonverbal—whatever works best for you. Experiment
with different ways to experience refuge, such as the sense that the refuge is
where you come from or that it flows through you.

## Exploring Your Refuges

Identify several of your refuges. Then apply this exploration to as many of
them as you like. You can do this with your eyes open or closed, slowly or
quickly. Instead of the suggested phrase, _I find refuge in,_ you could try:

_I take refuge in_ _________.
_I go for refuge to_ _________.
_I abide as_ _________.
_I come from_ _________.
_There is_ _________.
_________ _flows through me._
_I am one with_ _________.
Or whatever you like.
_Bring to mind a refuge. Get a feeling or idea of it, and sense it in your_

_body. Get a sense of how it’s wholesome for you to take refuge there. To_
_have its influence in your life. To come from that place. To have its shelter_
_and protection._

_Say softly in your mind:_ I find refuge in _________. _Or wordlessly feel_

_yourself entering refuge there._

_Notice how it feels to have entered this refuge. Let that feeling sink in and_

_become a part of you._

_When you like, move on to the next refuge. And then to as many refuges_

_as you want._

_When you are finished entering your refuges, notice what the experience_

_as a whole feels like. Know that as you go through your days, you’ll carry_
_your refuges with you._

## chapter 5: Key Points

The most powerful way to use the mind-body connection to improve
your physical and mental health is through guiding your autonomic
nervous system (ANS). Every time you calm the ANS through
stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), you tilt your
body, brain, and mind increasingly toward inner peace and wellbeing.
You can activate the PNS in many ways, including relaxation, big
exhalations, touching the lips, mindfulness of the body, imagery,
balancing your heartbeat, and meditation.
Meditation increases gray matter in brain regions that handle
attention, compassion, and empathy. It also helps a variety of
medical conditions, strengthens the immune system, and improves
psychological functioning.
Deliberately feeling safer helps control the hardwired tendency to
look for and overreact to threats. Feel safer by relaxing, using
imagery, connecting with others, being mindful of fear itself,
evoking inner protectors, being realistic, and increasing your sense
of secure attachment.
Find refuge in whatever is a sanctuary and refueling station for you.
Potential refuges include people, activities, places, and intangible
things like reason, a sense of your innermost being, or truth.

# Strong Intentions

_Do all that you can, with all that you have, in the time that you have, in_

_the place where you are._

—Nkosi Johnson

The previous chapter focused on cooling down greed and hatred to reduce
the causes of suffering. This chapter is about “warming up” the inner
strength that will increase the causes of your happiness. You’ll see how
your brain gets motivated—how it establishes intentions and pursues them
—and how to use these neural networks to move forward strongly in the
days to come. To be alive is to lean into the future (Thompson 2007), to
stretch for the next breath or meal. Or reach for happiness, love, and
wisdom.

## The Neuroaxis

Your brain evolved from the bottom up and the inside out, along what is
called the _neuroaxis_ (Lewis and Todd 2007; Tucker, Derryberry, and Luv
2000), which is one way to conceptualize the organization of the brain.
Starting at the base, let’s explore how each of the four main levels of the
neuroaxis supports your intentions.

Figure 7: The Neuroaxis


-----

**Brain Stem**

The brain stem sends neuromodulators such as norepinephrine and

dopamine throughout your brain in order to get you ready for action, keep
you energized while you pursue your goals, and reward you when you
attain them.

**Diencephalon**

The _diencephalon_ consists of the thalamus (the brain’s central

switchboard for sensory information) and the hypothalamus, which directs
your autonomic nervous system and influences your endocrine system
through the pituitary gland. The hypothalamus regulates primal drive states
(e.g., for water, food, sex) and primal emotions (e.g., terror, rage).

**Limbic System**


-----

The limbic system evolved from the diencephalon, and includes the

amygdala, hippocampus, and basal ganglia. It’s basically Grand Central
Station for emotion.

Limbic structures lie to the sides of the diencephalon, and in some cases

beneath it (e.g., amygdala). They are considered a higher level in the
neuroaxis since they are more recent in evolution—even though some of
these structures are lower down, which can be a little confusing.

**Cortex**

The cortex includes the prefrontal cortex (PFC), cingulate, and insula.

These regions—which play a prominent role in this book—handle abstract
reasoning and concepts, values, planning, and the “executive functions” of
organization, self-monitoring, and impulse control. The cortex also includes
the sensory and motor strips that stretch more less from ear to ear (sensation
and movement), the parietal lobes (perception), the temporal lobes
(language and memory), and the occipital lobe (vision).

These four levels work together to keep you motivated; they’re integrated

up and down the neuroaxis. In general, the lower levels orient and energize
the upper ones, which guide and inhibit the lower ones. The lower levels
have more direct control over your body and less capacity to change their
own neural networks. The upper levels are the opposite: although they’re
more removed from the action, they have vastly greater neuroplasticity—
the capacity to be shaped by neural/mental activity, to learn from
experience. At all levels of the neuroaxis, the intentions—the goals and
related strategies—at work in your life operate mainly outside of your
awareness.

The farther down the neuroaxis, the more immediate the reactions; higher

up on the neuroaxis, time frames stretch. For example, cortical influences
help you pass up a reward right now in order to gain a greater one in the
future (McClure et al. 2004). Usually, the longer the view, the wiser the
intentions.

## The Motivational Macrosystem


-----

**The Anterior Cingulate Cortex Hub**

Although each part of the neuroaxis works with the others, two regions in

particular are hubs, sending out neural spokes in many directions: the
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala. Let’s start with the ACC
(for more details, see Lewis and Todd, 2007; Paus 2001).

The ACC is closely connected to the evolutionarily recent _dorsal_ (upper)

and (outer) regions of the prefrontal cortex, known by the mouthwatering acronym DLPFC. The DLPFC is a key neural _lateral_ _substrate_ , or basis,
of _working memory_ , which is a kind of workspace where your brain gathers
information to solve problems and make decisions. The ACC is also closely
connected to the supplementary motor area, where new actions are planned.
Through these links, your ACC guides your actions to fulfill your
intentions.

When an intention crystallizes, your inner experience of things coming

together toward a unified aim reflects a _neural coherence_ . In the cortical
“spokes” of the ACC, many far-flung (on the microscopic scale of cells)
regions start pulsing together, matching the phases—the highs and lows—of
their firing rhythms, typically in the gamma range of neural synchrony: 30
to 80 times a second (Thompson and Varela 2001).

The ACC is the primary overseer of your attention. It monitors progress

toward your goals, and flags any conflicts among them. Its upper layers
manage _effortful control_ , the deliberate and sustained regulation of thoughts
and behavior. These areas don’t fully develop until ages three to six (Posner
and Rothbart 2000), a major reason why young children have less selfcontrol than older ones. Any time you consciously exercise your will, your
ACC is involved.

Through its dense, reciprocal connections to the amygdala, hippocampus,

and hypothalamus, the ACC influences your emotions and is influenced by
them as well. Therefore, it’s a key site for the integration of thinking and
feeling (Lewis 2005). Strengthening the ACC—such as through meditation
—helps you think clearly when you’re upset, and brings warmth and
emotional intelligence to your logical reasoning.

In sum, the ACC is at the center of top-down, deliberate, centralized,

reasoned motivation.


-----

**The Amygdala Hub**

Through its own dense connections to the ACC, PFC, hippocampus,

hypothalamus, basal ganglia, and brain stem, the amygdala is the second
major hub of motivational activity.

Moment to moment, the amygdala spotlights what’s relevant and

important to you: what’s pleasant and unpleasant, what’s an opportunity and
what’s a threat. It also shapes and shades your perceptions, appraisals of
situations, attributions of intentions to others, and judgments. It exerts these
influences largely outside of your awareness, which increases their power
since they operate out of sight.

When you get motivated in any significant way, it means the subcortical

regions that connect to the amygdala have synchronized with each other.
The neural networks in the limbic system, hypothalamus, and brain stem
start pulsing together, usually in the theta frequency of four to seven times a
second (Kocsis and Vertes 1994; Lewis 2005).

In sum, the amygdala is at the center of bottom-up, reactive, distributed,

passionate motivation.

**Head and Heart**

Together, the ACC and amygdala hubs form a joint system that’s

involved in just about every aspect of motivated activity. These hubs
modulate each other; for example, in a three-step feedback loop, the
amygdala excites the lower parts of your ACC, which then excite its upper
parts, which in turn inhibit the amygdala (Lewis and Todd 2007).
Consequently, the ostensibly rational ACC-based network is deeply
involved in your emotions and drives through its downward projections into
the three lower levels of the neuroaxis. Meanwhile, the supposedly
irrational amygdala-based network helps construct your appraisals, values,
and strategies through its upward projections into the cortex.

This integration can happen within a fraction of a second, as neural

populations all along the neuroaxis synchronize with each other in response
to motivationally meaningful information, phase-locking their rhythms
together. In a more general way, such integration can continue for many
years. Consider how your “cool” ACC-based and “warm” amygdala-based


-----

motivations have worked together in the important areas of your life. For
example, warmhearted advocacy for a child with special needs benefits
from cool clarity about how to keep working with a school district to get the
most resources for her.

On the other hand, these two hubs can also be out of step or tug against

each other. For example, during adolescence, the amygdala-based network
often overpowers the ACC-based network. In terms of your own
motivations, are your ACC- and amygdala-based networks equally strong?
And are they—head and heart, metaphorically speaking—pulling in the
same direction? For example, I realized some years ago that the training of
my head had gotten out in front of the cultivation of my heart, so I’ve been
focusing more on the latter ever since.

**Intentions and Suffering**

It is sometimes said that desire leads to suffering, but is that always true?

The territory of desire is far-reaching, and it includes wishes, intentions,
hopes, and cravings. Whether a desire leads to suffering depends on two
factors: Is craving—the sense that you need something—involved? And
what is the desire _for_ ? Regarding the first of these, desire per se is not the
root of suffering; craving is. You can wish for or intend something without
craving the results; for example, you can decide to get eggs from the
refrigerator without craving them—and without getting upset if there are
none left.

Regarding the second factor, intentions are a double-edged sword that

can either hurt or help. For example, the Three Poisons—greed, hatred, and
delusion—are a kind of intention: to grab pleasure and hold on tight, resist
pain and anything else you don’t like, and ignore or distort things you’d
rather not know about.

Harmful intentions operate at all levels of the brain, from rage and fear

released by the hypothalamus to subtle plans for payback constructed by the
PFC. But the same is also true of wholesome inclinations toward generosity,
kindness, and insight: they ripple up and down the neuroaxis, from visceral
brain stem energy for good causes to abstract ideals sustained by the PFC.
As you weave positive inclinations more deeply into the different levels of
your brain, you increasingly push the Three Poisons to the margins. It’s


-----

important to nurture good intentions at _all_ levels of the neuroaxis—and to
cultivate the strength to carry them out.

## Feeling Strong

During a break from college, I helped take a dozen school kids backpacking
through the Yosemite high country. We didn’t see anyone all day before
stopping for lunch at a rocky area by a river, where the trail disappeared.
Then we headed into the forest, where we picked up the trail again. A mile
or so later, one of the kids realized he’d left his jacket back by the river. I
said I’d go get it and meet the group at our campground several miles
ahead. Dropping my pack by the side of the trail, I returned to our lunch
area, searched around, and found the jacket.

But now I couldn’t find the trail. After casting about for a while amidst

the jumbled boulders, it really hit me: it was late afternoon, the only people
around were miles away, it was already getting chilly, and I was looking at
spending the night at 6,000 feet in a T-shirt and jeans. Then an
unprecedented and powerful sense came over me. I felt like a feral animal,
like a hawk that would do whatever it takes to survive. I felt a fierce
determination to live through the day and, if need be, the night. Newly
energized, I scrambled in widening circles, finally finding the trail. I made
it to our campsite later that night. I’ve never forgotten the intense feelings
of that day, and have drawn on them for strength many times since.

When have you felt really strong yourself? What was that experience like

—in your body, your emotions, and your thoughts? Strength is often quiet,
receptive determination rather than chest-thumping pushiness. One of the
strongest people I’ve ever known was my mother, who just kept taking care
of her family no matter what.

**Feeling Stronger**

Strength has two primary aspects: energy and determination. You can

intensify these by quickening your breathing a little, or by tightening your
shoulders slightly, as if you’re bracing to carry a load. Get familiar with the
muscle movements—often subtle ones—associated with strength. Just as


-----

making the facial expression of an emotion will heighten that feeling
(Niedenthal 2007), engaging the muscle movements of strength will
increase your experience of it.

Get in the habit of deliberately calling up a sense of strength—not to

dominate anybody or anything, but to fuel your intentions (see the exercise,
“Many Ways to Feel Strong”). Involve the entire neuroaxis in order to
power up your experience of strength. For example, bring to mind a sense
of visceral, muscular willfulness to stimulate your brain stem to send
norepinephrine and dopamine like a rising fountain up into the rest of your
brain for arousal and drive. Bring the limbic system into the action by
focusing on how good it feels to be strong, so you’ll be increasingly drawn
to strength in the future. Add the power of cortical language by commenting
on the experience to yourself: _I’m feeling strong. It’s good to be strong._
Notice any beliefs that it’s bad or wrong to be strong, and send them on
their way with counterthoughts like _Strength helps me do good things. I_
_have the right to be strong._ Make sure that the intentions at all levels of
your neuroaxis are heading in the same direction.

When you experience strength—whether you evoked it deliberately or it

just came to mind—consciously take it in so it deepens its traces in implicit
memory and becomes a part of you.

## Many Ways to Feel Strong

There are many ways to find and intensify the feeling of strength. This
exercise explores some of them; feel free to adapt it however you like. It’s
best to keep your eyes open during it, since you’ll want strength in
everyday situations in which your eyes are open.

_Take a breath and come into yourself. Be aware of thoughts passing_

_through your mind without any need to engage with them. Feel the strength_
_in awareness, always clear and everlasting, no matter what passes through_
_it._

_Now sense the vitality in your body. Notice how your breathing has a_

_strength of its own. Sense your muscles, your capacity to move in any_
_direction. Sense the animal strength in your body (even if it is also weak in_
_some ways)._


-----

_Recall a time when you felt really strong. Imagine that situation as_

_intensely as you can. Bring to mind the sense of strength you experienced._
_Strength in your breathing, energy in your arms and legs. That same_
_strength is beating today in your powerful heart. Whatever you feel is fine._
_And continue to open to the sense that you are strong, clear, and_
_determined. Notice how it feels good to feel strong. Let strength sink into_
_your being. (If you like, recall additional times you felt strong.)_

_Now, continuing to feel strong, bring to mind a person (or group of_

_people) who supports you. Make this as real as possible; imagine this_
_person’s face, the sound of his or her voice. Let yourself feel supported,_
_valued, believed in. Sense how this feeling of support increases your sense_
_of strength. Notice how it feels good to feel strong. Let strength sink into_
_your being. (You can repeat this for other people who support you.)_

_Notice any other feelings coming up, too—perhaps even opposite ones_

_like weakness. Whatever is arising is fine. Just notice it, let it be, and let it_
_go. Turn your attention back to your sense of being strong._

_Finally, abiding in a sense of strength, bring to awareness a challenging_

_situation. Solid in your strength, feel a spaciousness around that difficult_
_condition. Allow it to be what it is while you continue to feel strong and_
_centered. Be strong, with no need to grasp or struggle in any way. Any_
_problems are flowing through awareness like clouds across the sky. Be_
_spacious, relaxed, and easy. Feel the strength, in your breathing, in your_
_awareness, in the clarity of your mind, in the wholeness of your body, in_
_your good intentions._

_As you go through your day, pay attention to the sense of feeling strong._

_Notice how it feels good to feel strong. Let strength sink into your being._

## chapter 6: Key Points

It’s important both to cool the causes of suffering and to warm up
the causes of happiness—such as your intentions. Intentions involve
strength applied to clear and appropriate goals, sustained over time.
Most of the intentions operating in your brain do so outside of
awareness.


-----

To simplify, your brain evolved in four levels, along a kind of
neuroaxis; these levels work together to keep you motivated. From
the bottom up, along the neuroaxis, they are the brain stem,
diencephalon, limbic system, and cortex.
In general, the farther down the neuroaxis a response takes place,
the faster, more intense, and more automatic it is. Higher on the
neuroaxis, responses become more delayed, less intense, and more
considered. In particular, the cortex—the most evolutionarily recent
level—really enhances your capacity to take the future into account.
Usually, the longer the view, the wiser the intentions.
The neuroaxis has two hubs: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
and the amygdala. The ACC-based network manages top-down,
deliberate, centralized, reasoned motivation, while the amygdalabased network handles bottom-up, reactive, distributed, passionate
motivation.
These two networks are woven together. For example, the “logical”
ACC-based network guides the flow of your feelings, and the
“emotional” amygdala-based network shapes your values and
worldview.
The two networks—metaphorically the head and the heart—can
support each other, be awkwardly out of sync, or struggle in outright
conflict. Ideally, your intentions will be aligned with each other at
all levels of the neuroaxis: that’s when they have the most power.
Intentions are a form of desire. Desire per se is not the root of
suffering; craving is. The key is to have wholesome intentions
without being attached to their results.
Inner strength comes in many forms, including quiet perseverance.
Get familiar with what strength feels like in your body so you can
call it up again. Deliberately stimulate feelings of strength to deepen
their neural pathways.

# Equanimity

_Equanimity is a perfect, unshakable balance of mind._

—Nyanaponika Thera

Imagine that your mind is like a house with a mud-room—the entry room in
cold climates where people put their messy boots and dripping coats. With
_equanimity_ , your initial reactions to things—reach for this carrot, push
away that stick—are left in a mental mud-room so that the interior of your
mind remains clear and clean and peaceful.

The word equanimity comes from Latin roots meaning “even” and

“mind.” With equanimity, what passes through your mind is held with
spaciousness so you stay even-keeled and aren’t thrown off balance. The
ancient circuitry of the brain is continually driving you to react one way or
another—and equanimity is your circuit breaker. Equanimity breaks the
chain of suffering by separating the feeling tones of experience from the
machinery of craving, neutralizing your reactions to those feeling tones.

For example, one time I came home from a meditation retreat, we sat

down to dinner, and soon our kids were doing their usual bickering.
Normally this would have bothered me, but because of the equanimity
gained from the retreat, the irritation in my mind was like an annoying fan
yelling from the upper bleachers in a stadium far above me, while I was
down below and not hijacked by it. Psychologists have a term— _demand_
_characteristics_ —for the aspects of situations that really pull at you, like a
doorbell ringing or someone reaching out his hand to shake yours. With
equanimity, situations have only characteristics, not demands.

Equanimity is neither apathy nor indifference: you are warmly engaged

with the world but not troubled by it. Through its nonreactivity, it creates a
great space for compassion, loving-kindness, and joy at the good fortune of
others. For example, the Buddhist teacher Kamala Masters tells the story of


-----

taking a boat down the Ganges at dawn. On her left, the sun lit ancient
towers and temples with an exquisite rosy glow. On her right, funeral pyres
were burning, and the sounds of wailing rose up with the smoke. Beauty to
the left and death to the right, with equanimity opening her heart wide
enough to include both. You draw on this same equanimity to stay centered
and large-hearted when you face situations that have great personal impact,
such as when you—or a dear friend—lose a loved one.

## A Taste of Equanimity

If you like, take some time here to get a taste of equanimity. It won’t be the
all-encompassing sense that is available in the deepest meditations, but it
will give you a feeling for the evenness, clarity, and peacefulness of this
state of mind.

_Relax. Take a few minutes to steady your mind by focusing on the_

_sensations of breathing in your belly or chest, or around your upper lip._

_Become increasingly mindful of the changing feeling tones—pleasant,_

_unpleasant, or neutral—of your experience._

_Sense a growing impartiality toward whatever arises, an ease, a relaxed_

_and undisturbed presence. Accept and be at peace with whatever is arising._
_Let your mind become increasingly steady, quiet, and collected._

_Be aware of sounds. Hear without being caught by what’s heard. Be_

_aware of sensations. Sense without being caught by what’s sensed. Be_
_aware of thoughts. Think without being caught by what’s thought._

_Notice how pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral feeling tones come and go._

_They’re constantly changing, and not a dependable basis for happiness._

_Be aware of passing thoughts and feelings without identifying with them._

_No one needs to own them._

_Be aware of passing thoughts and feelings without reacting to them._

_Notice a growing disengagement. There’s less tilting toward pleasure, less_
_pulling back from pain._

_In the pleasant, there is just the pleasant, with no reactions added. In the_

_unpleasant, there is just the unpleasant, with no reactions added. In the_


-----

_neutral, there is just the neutral, with no reactions added. This is the mind_
_of no preferences. Rest as awareness, free from reactions._

_Abide as equanimity. Breath after breath. At ease. Settle into deeper and_

_deeper layers of equanimity. As you can, sense a sublime freedom,_
_contentment, and peace._

_If they aren’t already open, open your eyes. Bring visual sensations into_

_your equanimity. Explore the mind of no preferences for whatever crosses_
_your gaze, be it pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. Move your body a bit as_
_you finish the meditation. Explore the mind of no preferences for body_
_sensations, be they pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral._

_As your day proceeds, notice what it’s like to bring more equanimity to_

_people and situations._

## The Equanimous Brain

When you are equanimous, you don’t grasp after enjoyable experiences or
push against disagreeable ones. Rather, you have a kind of space around
experiences—a buffer between you and their feeling tones. This state of
being is not based on standard prefrontal control of emotions, in which
there is inhibition and direction of limbic activity. Instead, with equanimity,
the limbic system can fire however it “wants.” The primary point of
equanimity is not to reduce or channel that activation, but _simply not to_
_respond to it._ This is very unusual behavior for the brain, which is designed
by evolution to respond to limbic signals, particularly to pulses of pleasant
and unpleasant feeling tones. What could be happening, neurologically, to
accomplish this? Let’s look at the different aspects of equanimity and the
parts of the brain they likely involve.

**Understanding and Intention**

With equanimity, you see into the transient and imperfect nature of

experience, and your aim is to remain _disenchanted_ —free of the spells cast
by pleasure and pain. In this—rather Buddhist—sense of the word,
disenchanted, you are not disappointed or dissatisfied with life; you simply


-----

see through its apparent charms and alarms and are not knocked off center
by either.

Understanding and intention are both grounded in the prefrontal cortex.

The intention to remain equanimous relies in particular on the anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC) hub in the neuroaxis.

**Great Steadiness of Mind**

Equanimity also involves remaining aware of the passing stream without

letting any bit of it hook you. This entails anterior cingulate oversight,
especially in the beginning stages of equanimity. As equanimity deepens,
meditators report an effortless continuity of mindfulness, which presumably
correlates with reduced ACC activity and self-organizing stability in the
neural substrates of awareness.

**A Global Workspace of Consciousness**

Another aspect of equanimity is an unusually expansive _global_

_workspace of consciousness_ (Baars 1997), the neural complement to the
mental sense of great spaciousness surrounding the objects of awareness.
This could be enabled by stable and far-reaching gamma-wave
synchronization of billions of neurons across large areas of the brain,
rhythmically firing together 30– 80 times a second. Interestingly, this
atypical brainwave pattern is seen in Tibetan monks with lots of meditation
practice—and a lot of equanimity (Lutz et al. 2004).

**Dampening the Stress-Response System**

The limbic, HPAA, and sympathetic nervous systems react to each other

in circular ways. For example, if something frightening occurs, your body
will tend to become activated (e.g., increased heart rate, sweaty palms);
those bodily changes will be interpreted by the limbic system as evidence of
a threat, which will trigger more fear reactions in a vicious cycle. Through
activating the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), you prevent the
stress-response system from reacting to its own reactions. This is one


-----

reason why the training for equanimity in contemplative settings involves
considerable relaxation and tranquility.

**The Fruits of Equanimity**

Over time, equanimity deepens into a profound inner stillness that is a

defining characteristic of contemplative absorption (Brahm 2006). It also
becomes increasingly woven into daily life, bringing great benefit. If you
can break the link between feeling tones and craving—if you can be with
the pleasant without chasing after it, with the unpleasant without resisting it,
and with the neutral without ignoring it—then you have cut the chain of
suffering, at least for a time. And that is an incredible blessing and freedom.


## Developing the Factors of Equanimity

While complete equanimity is an uncommon state for both the mind and the
brain, a basic sense of it can be experienced in everyday life and developed
with practice. The underlying neural factors we’ve explored suggest a
number of ways to encourage this process.

**Understanding**

Recognize the fleeting nature of rewards and that they usually aren’t

actually all that great. See, too, that painful experiences are transient and
usually not that awful. Neither pleasure nor pain is worth claiming as your
own or identifying with. Further, consider how every event is determined
by countless preceding factors so that things can not be any other way. This
is not fatalism or despair: you can take action to make the _future_ different.


-----

But even then, remember that most of the factors that shape the future are
out of your hands. You can do everything right, and still the glass will
break, the project will go nowhere, you’ll catch the flu, or a friend will
remain upset.


**Intention**

Keep reminding yourself of the important reasons for equanimity: you

want more freedom from craving and the suffering it brings. Routinely
recall your intention to be aware of the feeling tone, to be spacious around
it, and to let it be whatever it is without reacting to it. To help hold this in
mind, put a little sticky note with “equanimity” on it near your computer or
telephone, or use a picture of a beautiful, tranquil setting.

**Steadiness of Mind**

Chapters 11 and 12 will explore various ways to cultivate an increasingly

stable presence of mind. As your mind grows steadier, pay particular
attention to the neutral feeling tone. Stimuli that evoke a pleasant or
unpleasant feeling tone stir up more brain activity than neutral tones do,
because there is more to think about and respond to. Since your brain
doesn’t naturally stay engaged with neutral stimuli, you must make a
conscious effort to sustain attention to them. Through sensitizing yourself to
the neutral aspects of experience, your mind will become more comfortable
staying with them, and less inclined to seek rewards or scan for threats. In
time, the neutral tone can become, as my teacher Christina Feldman puts it,
a “doorway to the eventless”—an entry into the stillness of the ground of
being, which never changes and is always the same.


-----

**Spacious Awareness**

Imagine the contents of your mind coming and going in a vast open space

of awareness, like shooting stars. The feeling tones of experience are just
more contents moving through this space. Boundless space surrounds them
—dwarfing them, untroubled by them, unaffected by their passing. The
space of awareness allows every content of mind to be or not to be, to come
and to go. Thoughts are just thoughts, sounds are just sounds, situations are
just situations, and people are just being themselves. As Ajahn Sumedho
said during a talk at Chithurst Monastery, “Trust in awareness, in being
awake, rather than in transient and unstable conditions” (2006).

**Tranquility**

This involves not acting based on the feeling tone. For example, you

don’t automatically move toward something just because it is pleasant. In
the words of the Third Zen Patriarch: “The Great Way is not difficult for
those who have no preferences” (Kornfield 1996, 143). Set aside a period of
your day—even just a minute long—to consciously release preferences for
or against anything. Then extend this practice to more and more of your
day. Your actions will be guided increasingly by your values and virtues,
not by desires that are reactions to positive or negative feeling tones.

Tranquility involves parasympathetic activation, which you’ve learned

how to encourage in chapter 5. Make a list of situations that trigger strong
greed or hatred (broadly defined) in you, arranged from mild triggers all the
way up to your equivalent of a four-alarm fire. Then, starting with the easier
situations and working your way up the list, deliberately focus on bringing
greater tranquility to them by using some of chapter 5’s approaches, such as
big exhalations, being mindful of the fear, or taking refuge.

Inner peace can definitely be sustained in difficult circumstances. Here

are two examples that are worlds apart, yet have aspects of equanimity in
common:

Think of Joe Montana playing football, guiding the 49ers downfield

while 300-pound defensive linemen rushed to crush him to the ground. His
teammates said that the crazier and more desperate the game got, the cooler
Joe became. My wife and I used to joke: _Three minutes left in the fourth_


-----

_quarter of the Super Bowl, eighty yards to go for the game-winning_
_touchdown—Joe’s got them right where he wants them!_

And consider Ramana Maharshi, the great Indian saint who passed away

in 1950. Toward the end of his life, he developed cancer in his arm.
Although this must have been very painful, he remained serene and loving
throughout his final days. One time he looked down with a beautiful smile
and said simply, “Poor arm.”

Buddhism has a metaphor for the different conditions in life. They’re

called the Eight Worldly Winds: pleasure and pain, praise and blame, gain
and loss, fame and ill repute. As you develop greater equanimity, these
winds have less effect on your mind. Your happiness becomes increasingly
unconditional, not based on catching a good breeze instead of a bad one.

## chapter 7: Key Points

Equanimity means not reacting to your reactions, whatever they are.
Equanimity creates a buffer around the feeling tones of experiences
so that you do not react to them with craving. Equanimity is like a
circuit breaker that blocks the normal sequence in the mind that
moves from feeling tone to craving to clinging to suffering.
Equanimity is not coldness, indifference, or apathy. You are present
in the world but not upset by it. The spaciousness of equanimity is a
great support for compassion, kindness, and joy at the happiness of
others.
In daily life and meditation, deepen your equanimity by becoming
increasingly mindful of the feeling tones of experience and
increasingly disenchanted with them. They come and they go, and
they’re not worth chasing or resisting.
Equanimity is an unusual brain state. It is not based on prefrontal
inhibition of the limbic system. Rather, it involves not reacting to
the limbic system. This probably draws on four neural conditions:
prefrontal and anterior cingular cortex (ACC) activation for
understanding and intention; steadiness of mind, driven initially by
ACC oversight but then self-organizing; fast gamma-wave
entrainment of large areas of the brain to create the mental


-----

experience of great spaciousness; and parasympathetic activation to
dampen limbic/SNS/HPAA feedback loops that would otherwise
make the stress-response system react to its own reactions in vicious
cycles.
You can strengthen the neural factors of equanimity with the
methods summarized in this chapter and discussed in greater detail
throughout this book. As you do this, your happiness will become
increasingly unconditional and unshakeable.

# Two Wolves in the Heart

_All sentient beings developed through natural selection in such a way_

_that pleasant sensations serve as their guide, and especially the pleasure_

_derived from sociability and from loving our families._

—Charles Darwin

I heard a story once about a Native American elder who was asked how she
had become so wise, so happy, and so respected. She answered: “In my
heart, there are two wolves: a wolf of love and a wolf of hate. It all depends
on which one I feed each day.”

This story always gives me a little shiver. It’s both humbling and hopeful.

First, the wolf of love is very popular, but who among us does not also
harbor a wolf of hate? We can hear its snarling both far away in distant wars
and close to home in our own anger and aggression, even toward people we
love. Second, the story suggests that we each have the ability—grounded in
daily actions—to encourage and strengthen empathy, compassion, and
kindness while also restraining and reducing ill will, disdain, and
aggression.

What are these wolves and where did they come from? And how can we

feed the wolf of love and starve the wolf of hate? This chapter considers the
first question; the next two chapters explore the second.

## The Evolution of Relationship

Although the wolf of hate gets more headlines, the wolf of love has been
painstakingly bred by evolution to be more powerful—and more central to
your deepest nature. In the long march from tiny sponges in the ancient seas
to humanity today, relating well to other members of one’s species has been


-----

a great aid to survival. During the past 150-million-year journey of animal
evolution, the advantages of social abilities were arguably the most
influential factor driving the development of the brain. There were three
major advances, and you benefit from them every day.

**Vertebrates**

The first proto-mammals probably lived about 180 million years ago,

followed by the earliest birds around 30 million years later (these dates are
approximate because of the ambiguous fossil record). Mammals and birds
face survival challenges similar to those of reptiles and fish—harsh habitats
and hungry predators—yet in proportion to body weight, mammals and
birds have bigger brains. Why?

Reptiles and fish usually don’t take care of their young—and may in fact

eat them!—and typically make their way in life without a partner. By
contrast, mammals and birds raise their young, and in many cases, they
form pair bonds, sometimes for life.

In the dry language of evolutionary neuroscience, the “computational

requirements” of selecting a good mate, sharing food, and keeping young
alive required increased neural processing in mammals and birds (Dunbar
and Shultz 2007). A squirrel or sparrow has to be smarter than a lizard or
shark: better able to plan, communicate, cooperate, and negotiate. These are
the exact skills that human couples discover are critical when they become
parents, especially if they want to remain mates.

**Primates**

The next major step in brain evolution occurred with the primates that

first appeared roughly 80 million years ago. Their defining characteristic
was and is great sociability. For example, monkeys and apes spend up to a
sixth of their day grooming other members of their troop. Interestingly, in
one species studied—Barbary macaques—the groomers experienced more
stress relief than the groomees (Shutt et al. 2007). (I’ve tried to use this
rationale to get more back scratches from my wife, but so far she’s not
buying it.) The evolutionary bottom line is that, for both female and male


-----

primates, social success—which reflects relationship skills—leads to more
offspring (Silk 2007).

In fact, the more sociable a primate species is—measured by things like

breeding group size, number of grooming partners, and complexity of
hierarchies—the bigger its cortex is compared to the rest of the brain
(Dunbar and Shultz 2007; Sapolsky 2006). More-complex relationships
require more-complex brains.

Further, only the great apes—the most modern family of primates, which

includes chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and humans—have developed
_spindle cells_ , a remarkable type of neuron that supports advanced social
capabilities (Allman et al. 2001; Nimchinsky et al. 1999). For example,
great apes routinely console other members of their troop who are upset,
although this type of behavior is rare among other primates (de Waal 2006).
Like us, chimpanzees laugh and cry (Bard 2006).

Spindle cells are found only in the cingulate cortex and insula, indicating

that these regions—and their functions of empathy and self-awareness—
have experienced intense evolutionary pressure over the last several million
years (Allman et al. 2001; Nimchinsky et al. 1999). In other words, the
benefits of relationships helped drive the recent evolution of the primate
brain.

**Humans**

About 2.6 million years ago our hominid ancestors began making stone

tools (Semaw et al. 1997). Since then the brain has tripled in size, even
though it uses roughly ten times as many metabolic resources as an
equivalent amount of muscle (Dunbar and Shultz 2007). This enlargement
has challenged the female body to evolve, as well, in order to enable babies
with bigger brains to exit the birth canal (Simpson et al. 2008). Given its
biological costs, this rapid growth must have conferred great survival
benefits—and most of what’s been added is used for social, emotional,
linguistic, and conceptual processing (Balter 2007). For example, humans
have many more spindle neurons than the other great apes; these create a
kind of information superhighway running from the cingulate cortex and
the insula—two regions that are crucial to social and emotional intelligence
—to other parts of your brain (Allman et al. 2001). Although an adult


-----

chimpanzee is better than a two-year-old child at figuring out the physical
world, that young human is already much smarter about relationships
(Herrmann et al. 2007).

This process of neural evolution may seem dry and remote, but it played

out in the daily life-and-death struggles of beings like us in many ways. For
millions of years, until the advent of agriculture about 10,000 years ago, our
ancestors lived in hunter-gatherer bands, usually with fewer than 150
members (Norenzayan and Shariff 2008). They bred mainly within their
own band while searching for food, avoiding predators, and competing with
other bands for scarce resources. In that harsh environment, individuals
who cooperated with other members of their band typically lived longer and
left more offspring (Wilson 1999). Further, bands with strong teamwork
usually beat bands with weak teamwork at getting resources, surviving, and
passing on their genes (Nowak 2006).

Even small reproductive advantages in a single generation accumulate

significantly over time (Bowles 2006), much the way small differences in
team batting averages add up over the course of a long baseball season.
Over the 100,000 generations since tools were first invented, those genes
that fostered relationship abilities and cooperative tendencies pushed their
way forward in the human gene pool. We see the results today in the neural
underpinnings of many essential features of human nature, including
altruism (Bowles 2006; Judson 2007), generosity (Harbaugh, Mayr, and
Burghart 2007; Moll et al. 2006; Rilling et al. 2002), concern about
reputation (Bateson, Nettle, and Robert 2006), fairness (de Quervain et al.
2004; Singer et al. 2006), language (Cheney and Seyfarth 2008),
forgiveness (Nowak 2006), and morality and religion (Norenzayan and
Shariff 2008).

## Circuits of Empathy

Powerful evolutionary processes have shaped your nervous system to
produce the capabilities and inclinations that foster cooperative
relationships; they’ve nourished a large and friendly wolf in your heart.
Building on this general sociability, related neural networks support
_empathy_ , the capacity to sense the inner state of another person, which is
required for any kind of real closeness. If there were no empathy, we’d


-----

make our way in life like ants or bees, brushing shoulders with other people
but fundamentally alone.

Humans are by far the most empathic species on the planet. Our

remarkable capabilities rely on three neural systems that simulate another
person’s actions, emotions, and thoughts.

**Actions**

Networks in your brain’s perceptual-motor systems light up both when

you perform an action and when you see someone else perform that action,
giving you a felt sense of what he’s experiencing in his body (Oberman and
Ramachandran 2007). In effect, these networks mirror the behavior of
others, thus the common term, _mirror neurons_ .

**Emotions**

The insula and linked circuits activate when you experience strong

emotions such as fear or anger; they also light up when you see others
having those same feelings, particularly people you care about. The more
aware you are of your own emotional and bodily states, the more your
insula and anterior cingulate cortex activate—and the better you are at
reading others (Singer et al. 2004). In effect, the limbic networks that
produce your feelings also make sense of the feelings of others. As a result,
impairments in the expression of emotions—such as from a stroke—
frequently also worsen the recognition of emotions in other people
(Niedenthal 2007).

**Thoughts**

Psychologists use the term _theory of mind_ (ToM), to refer to your ability

to think about the inner workings of another person. ToM relies on
prefrontal and temporal lobe structures that are evolutionarily quite recent
(Gallagher and Frith 2003). ToM capabilities first appear during the third
and fourth years of life and don’t develop fully until the complete


-----

_myelination_ —the insulation of axons which speeds neural signals along—of
the prefrontal cortex in the late teens or early twenties (Singer 2006).

These three systems—tracking the actions, emotions, and thoughts of

other people—help each other. For example, sensorimotor and limbic
resonance with the actions and emotions of others gives you lots of data for
ToM-type processing. Then, once you form an educated guess—often
within just a few seconds—you can test it out on your body and your
feelings. Working together, these systems help you understand, from the
inside out, what it is like to be another person. In the next chapter, we’ll
cover a variety of ways to strengthen them.

## Love and Attachment

As the human brain evolved and grew larger, childhood grew longer
(Coward 2008). Consequently, hominid bands had to evolve ways to keep
their members connected for many years in order to sustain—in the African
proverb—“the village it takes to raise a child” and thus pass on the band’s
genes (Gibbons 2008). To accomplish this, the brain acquired powerful
circuitry and neurochemistry to generate and maintain love and attachment.

This is the physical foundation on which your mind has built your

experiences of romance, heartache, and deep affection, and your bonds with
family members. Of course, there is much more to love than the brain:
culture, gender, and personal psychology play major roles as well.
Nonetheless, a lot of research in developmental neuropsychology has shed
light on why love can go so wrong—and how to set it right.

**Love Feels Good**

Romantic love is found in almost all human cultures, suggesting that it’s

deep in our biological—even our biochemical—nature (Jankowiak and
Fischer 1992). Although endorphins and vasopressin are involved in the
neurochemistry of bonding and love, the major player is probably oxytocin
(Young and Wang 2004). This neuromodulator (and hormone) creates
feelings of caring and cherishing; it’s present in both females and males,
though much more so in women. Oxytocin encourages eye-to-eye contact


-----

(Guastella, Mitchell, and Dads 2008); increases trust (Kosfeld et al. 2005);
dampens amygdala arousal and promotes approach-type behaviors (Petrovic
et al. 2008); and supports tend-and-befriend behaviors in women when
they’re stressed (Taylor et al. 2000).

Distinct neural networks handle infatuation and long-term attachment

(Fisher, Aron, and Brown 2006). In its early stages, it’s natural for a
romantic relationship to be dominated by intense, often volatile rewards that
draw heavily on dopamine-based neural networks (Aron et al. 2005). Later,
the relationship shifts gradually toward more diffuse and stable fulfillments
that rely on oxytocin and related systems. Still, in long-term couples who
continue to feel deeply in love, ongoing tickles of dopamine keep
stimulating the pleasure centers of each partner’s brain (Schechner 2008).

**Losing Love Feels Bad**

Besides pursuing the pleasure of love, we try to avoid the pain of it

ending. When lovers get jilted, part of their limbic system lights up—the
same part that activates when making high-risk investments that could end
really badly (Fisher, Aron, and Brown 2006). Physical pain and social pain
are based on overlapping neural systems (Eisenberger and Lieberman
2004): quite literally, rejection hurts.

**Children and Attachment**

When combined with other influences—e.g., psychological, cultural, and

situational—these neurobiological factors often lead, no surprise, to babies.
Here, too, oxytocin promotes bonding, particularly in the mother.

Children evolved to be lovable and parents to be loving, since strong

attachments promote survival in the wild. The attachment system draws on
multiple neural networks—which handle empathy, self-awareness,
attention, emotion regulation, and motivation—to weave strong connections
between a child and her parents (Siegel 2001). The recurring experiences a
young child has with her caregivers course through these neural networks,
molding them and thus the way the child relates to others and feels about
herself. Hopefully all goes well—but these experiences occur at an age


-----

when children are most vulnerable, and their parents are usually most
stressed and depleted (Hanson, Hanson, and Pollycove 2002), which creates
inherent challenges. The human parent-child relationship is unique in the
animal kingdom, and it has a singular power to shape how each of us
pursues and expresses love as an adult; in the next chapter we’ll explore
how to work with the ways you may have been affected yourself.

## The Wolf of Hate

Our unique evolutionary background has made us wonderfully cooperative,
empathic, and loving. So why is our history so full of selfishness, cruelty,
and violence?

Economic and cultural factors certainly play a role. Nonetheless, across

different kinds of societies—hunter-gatherer, agrarian, and industrial;
communist and capitalist; Eastern and Western—in most cases the story is
basically the same: loyalty and protection toward “us,” and fear and
aggression toward “them.” We’ve already seen how that stance toward “us”
is deep in our nature. Now let’s investigate how fear and aggression
developed toward “them.”

**Nasty and Brutish**

For millions of years, our ancestors were exposed to starvation,

predators, and disease. Making matters worse, climactic ups and downs
brought scorching droughts and freezing ice ages, intensifying the
competition for scarce resources. Altogether, these harsh conditions kept
hominid and human population levels essentially flat despite potential
growth rates of about 2 percent per year (Bowles 2006).

In those tough environments, it was reproductively advantageous for our

ancestors to be cooperative within their own band but aggressive toward
other bands (Choi and Bowles 2007). Cooperation and aggression evolved
synergistically: bands with greater cooperation were more successful at
aggression, and aggression between bands demanded cooperation within
bands (Bowles 2009).


-----

Much like cooperation and love draw on multiple neurological systems,

so do aggression and hate:

Much if not most aggression is a response to feeling threatened—
which includes even subtle feelings of unease or anxiety. Because
the amygdala is _primed_ to register threats and is increasingly
sensitized by what it “perceives,” many people feel increasingly
threatened over time. And thus increasingly aggressive.
Once the SNS/HPAA system activates, if you’re going to fight
instead of flee, blood surges to your arm muscles for hitting,
_piloerection_ (goose bumps) makes your hair stand up to make you
look more intimidating to a potential attacker or predator, and the
hypothalamus can—in the extreme—trigger rage reactions.
Aggressiveness correlates with high testosterone—in both men and
women—and low serotonin.
Language systems in the left frontal and temporal lobes work with
visual-spatial processing in the right hemisphere to categorize others
as friends or foes, persons or nonentities.
“Hot” aggression—with lots of SNS/HPAA activation—often
overwhelms prefrontal regulation of emotions. “Cold” aggression
involves little SNS/HPAA activation and draws on sustained
prefrontal activity; consider the proverb “revenge is a dish best
served cold.”

The result of these neural dynamics is a familiar one: take good care of

“us,” and fear, disdain, and attack “them.” For example, research suggests
that most modern hunter-gatherer bands—which offer strong indications of
the social environments in which our ancestors evolved—have engaged in
ongoing conflicts with other groups. While these skirmishes lacked the
shock and awe of modern warfare, they were actually much more lethal:
roughly one in eight hunter-gatherer males died from them, compared to the
one in a hundred men who died from the wars of the twentieth century
(Bowles 2006; Keeley 1997).

Our brains still possess these capabilities and inclinations. They’re at

work in schoolyard cliques, office politics, and domestic violence. (Healthy
competition, assertiveness, and fierce advocacy for people and causes you
care about are very different from hostile aggression.) On a larger scale, our


-----

aggressive tendencies fuel prejudice, oppression, ethnic cleansing, and war.
Often these tendencies are manipulated, such as by the demonization of
“them” in the classic justification for strong-father, authoritarian control.
But those manipulations wouldn’t be nearly so successful if it weren’t for
the legacy of between-group aggression in our evolutionary history.

**What’s Left Out?**

The wolf of love sees a vast horizon, with all beings included in the circle

of “us.” That circle shrinks down for the wolf of hate, so that only the
nation, or tribe, or friends and family—or, in the extreme, only the
individual self—is held as “us,” surrounded by threatening masses of
“them.” In fact, sometimes the circle gets so small that one part of the mind
is hateful toward another part. For example, I’ve had clients who could not
look in the mirror because they thought they were so ugly.

There’s a Zen saying, _Nothing left out._ Nothing left out of your

awareness, nothing left out of your practice, nothing left out of your heart.
As the circle shrinks, the question naturally arises: What is left out? It could
be people on the other side of the world with a different religion, or people
next door whose politics you don’t like. Or relatives who are difficult, or
old friends who hurt you. It could be anyone you regard as less than you or
as merely a means to your ends.

As soon as you place anyone outside of the circle of “us,” the mind/brain

automatically begins to devalue that person and justify poor treatment of
him (Efferson, Lalive, and Feh 2008). This gets the wolf of hate up and
moving, only a quick pounce away from active aggression. Pay attention to
the number of times a day you categorize someone as “not like me,”
particularly in subtle ways: not my social background, not my style, and so
on. It’s startling how routine it is. See what happens to your mind when you
consciously release this distinction and focus instead on what you have in
common with that person, on what makes you both an “us.”

Ironically, one answer to “What’s left out?” is the wolf of hate itself,

which is often denied or minimized. For example, it makes me
uncomfortable to admit how good it feels when the hero kills the bad guy in
a movie. Like it or not, the wolf of hate is alive and well inside each one of
us. It’s easy to hear about a dreadful murder across the country or terrorism


-----

and torture across the world—or milder forms of everyday mistreatment of
others close at hand—and shake your head, thinking, “What’s wrong with
them?”But them is actually _us_ . We all have the same basic DNA. It is a kind
of ignorance—which is the root of suffering—to deny the aggression in our
genetic endowment. In fact, as we’ve seen, intense intergroup conflict aided
the evolution of within-group altruism: the wolf of hate helped give birth to
the wolf of love.

The wolf of hate is deeply embedded both in the human evolutionary past

and in each person’s brain today, ready to howl at any threat. Being realistic
and honest about the wolf of hate—and its impersonal, evolutionary origins
—brings self-compassion. Your own wolf of hate needs taming, sure, but
it’s not your fault that it lurks in the shadows of your mind, and it probably
afflicts you more than anyone else. Additionally, acknowledging the wolf of
hate prompts a very useful caution when you are in situations—arguing
with a neighbor, disciplining a child, reacting to criticism at work—in
which you feel mistreated and revved-up, and that wolf begins to stir.

When you’re watching the evening news—or even just listening to

children bicker—it can sometimes seem like the wolf of hate dominates
human existence. Much like spikes of SNS/HPAA arousal stand out against
a backdrop of resting-state parasympathetic activation, dark clouds of
aggression and conflict compel more attention than the much larger “sky”
of connection and love through which they pass. But in fact, most
interactions have a cooperative quality. Humans and other primate species
routinely restrain the wolf of hate and repair its damage, returning to a
baseline of reasonably positive relationships with each other (Sapolsky
2006). In most people most of the time, the wolf of love is bigger and
stronger than the wolf of hate.

Love and hate: they live and tumble together in every heart, like wolf

cubs tussling in a cave. There is no killing the wolf of hate; the aversion in
such an attempt would actually create what you’re trying to destroy. But
you can watch that wolf carefully, keep it tethered, and limit its alarm,
righteousness, grievances, resentments, contempt, and prejudice.

Meanwhile, keep nourishing and encouraging the wolf of love. We’ll
explore how to do that in the next two chapters.


-----

## chapter 8: Key Points

Each of us has two wolves in the heart, one of love and one of hate.
Everything depends on which one we feed each day.
While the wolf of hate gets more press, the wolf of love is actually
bigger and stronger, and its development over millions of years has
been a major factor in driving the evolution of the brain. For
example, mammals and birds have bigger brains than reptiles and
fish in large part to manage relationships with mates and offspring.
And the more sociable the primate species, the bigger the brain.
The size of the human brain has tripled in the past three million
years; much of this growth is devoted to interpersonal capabilities
such as empathy and cooperative planning. In the harsh conditions
faced by our ancestors, cooperation aided survival; thus, factors that
promote cooperation have been woven into your brain. These
include altruism, generosity, concern about reputation, fairness,
language, forgiveness, and morality and religion.
Empathy relies on three neural systems that simulate the actions,
emotions, and thoughts of others.
As the brain grew in size, early humans needed a longer childhood
to develop and train the brain; and as childhood grew longer, our
ancestors needed to find new ways to bond parents and children and
other members of the band in order to preserve “the village it takes
to raise a child.” Multiple neural networks accomplish this, such as
reward systems based on dopamine and oxytocin and punishment
systems in which social rejection creates activation much like
physical pain does.
Meanwhile, the wolf of hate also evolved. Hunter-gatherer bands
frequently engaged in highly lethal violence toward each other.
Within-group cooperation made between-group aggression more
successful, and the rewards of that aggression—food, mates,
survival—promoted within-group cooperation. Cooperation and
aggression—love and hate—co-evolved synergistically. Their
capabilities and inclinations remain within us today.
The wolf of hate shrinks the circle of “us,” sometimes to the point
that only the self is left inside it. The brain routinely categorizes


-----

“us” and “them,” and then automatically prefers “us” and devalues
“them.”
Ironically, sometimes the wolf of hate is set outside the circle of
“us.” But there is no killing the wolf of hate, and denying it just lets
it grow in the shadows. We need to acknowledge the wolf of hate
and appreciate the power of the wolf of love—and then restrain the
one while feeding the other.

## chapter 9

# Compassion and Assertion

_If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each_

_[person’s] life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm any hostility._

—Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

I sat on the board of a meditation center for nine years, and was often struck
by how its teachers expressed their views. They were compassionate about
the concerns of others, but when they said what they thought, they did so
clearly and often strongly, without hemming or hawing. And then they let it
be, not becoming defensive or argumentative. This combination of
openheartedness and directness was very powerful. It got the job done
while nurturing the love in the room.

This was compassion and assertion working together. They’re the two

wings that get any relationship off the ground and keep it flying. They
support each other: compassion brings caring to assertion, while assertion
helps you feel comfortable giving compassion since you know your own
needs will be met. Compassion widens the circle of “us” while assertion
protects and supports everyone inside it. They both nourish the wolf of
love. In this chapter, we’ll explore brain-savvy ways to use and strengthen
your inborn abilities to be compassionate and assertive, and we’ll begin
with compassion.

In order to be truly compassionate, you must first feel something of what

the other person is going through. You must have empathy, which cuts
through the automatic tendencies of the brain that create an “us” and a
“them.” So that’s where we’ll start.

## Empathy


-----

Empathy is the foundation of any meaningful relationship. When someone
empathizes with you, it gives you the sense that your inner being truly
exists for that person—that you are a Thou to his I, with feelings and needs
that have standing. Empathy reassures you that he understands your inner
workings at least somewhat, particularly your intentions and emotions. We
are social animals, who, as Dan Siegel puts it, need to feel _felt_ (2007) _._

Or let’s say you are the one who is offering empathy. Empathy is

respectful and soothing, and it usually evokes goodwill in return. Often
empathy is all the other person is asking of you; if there is still something
the person needs to talk about, you can address it in a more positive
atmosphere. Further, being empathic gives you lots of useful information
about the other person, including what’s really on her mind, and what she
really cares about. For example, if she’s being critical of you, sense down
into her deeper wants, particularly the softer and younger ones. Then you’ll
have a fuller picture, which will probably reduce any frustration or anger
toward her. She’ll likely sense this shift in you, and become more
understanding herself.

To be clear: empathy is neither agreement nor approval. You can

empathize with someone you wish would act differently. Empathy _doesn’t_
mean waiving your rights; knowing this can help you feel it’s alright to be
empathic.

In spiritual practice, empathy sees how we are all related to each other. It

is mindful and curious, with a “don’t know” quality that prevents you from
getting stuck in your own views. Empathy is virtue in action, the restraint of
reactive patterns in order to stay present with another person. It embodies
non-harming, since a lack of empathy is often upsetting to others, and also
opens the door to hurting them unwittingly. Empathy contains an inherent
generosity: you give the willingness to be moved by another person.

**Empathic Breakdowns**

For all its benefits, empathy disappears quickly during most conflicts,

and fades away slowly in many long-term relationships. Unfortunately,
inadequate empathy erodes trust and makes it harder to solve interpersonal
problems. Just recall a time you felt misunderstood—or worse, a time when
the other person didn’t even want to understand you. A history of empathic


-----

breakdowns has effects; the more vulnerable a person is and the higher the
stakes, the greater the impact. For example, insufficient caregiver empathy
often leads to insecure attachment in a young child. In the larger world,
empathic breakdowns lead to exploitation, prejudice, and terrible atrocities.
There’s no empathy in the wolf of hate.

**How to Be Empathic**

Your natural capacity for empathy can be brought forth deliberately, used

skillfully, and strengthened. Here’s how to work with the brain’s empathy
circuits.

**SET THE STAGE**

Bring conscious intention to being empathic. For example, when I realize

that my wife wants to have one of _those_ conversations—she’s not happy
about something, and it’s probably me—I try to take a few seconds to
remind myself to be empathic and not lame, and that it feels good to be
empathic. These little steps activate the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to orient
you to the situation, focus your intentions, and prime empathy-related
neural networks; they also warm up the limbic system to get your brain
headed toward the rewards of empathy.

Next, relax your body and mind, and open to the other person as much as

feels right to you. Use the methods in the next section to feel safe and
strong enough to receive the other person fully. Remind yourself that
whatever is in his mind is over _there_ , and you’re over _here_ , present with but
separate from the stream of his thoughts and feelings.

Keep paying attention to the other person; be _with_ him. This sort of

sustained attention is uncommon, and other people appreciate it a lot.
Appoint a little guardian in your mind that keeps watching the continuity of
your attentiveness; this will stimulate the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
which pays attention to attention. (We’ll say more about this guardian in
chapter 12.) In a way, empathy is a kind of mindfulness meditation focused
on someone else’s inner world.

**NOTICE THE ACTIONS OF OTHERS**


-----

Notice the other person’s movements, stance, gestures, and actions. (The

point is to energize the perceptual-motor mirroring functions of your brain,
not to analyze her body language.) Imagine doing these yourself. What
would it feel like, in your own body, to do them? If it’s appropriate, match
some of her movements unobtrusively with your own, and notice what this
feels like.

**SENSE THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS**

Tune in to yourself. Sense your breathing, body, and emotions. As we’ve

seen, this stimulates your insula and primes it to sense the inner feelings of
others.

Watch the other person’s face and eyes closely. Our core emotions are

expressed through universal facial expressions (Ekman 2007). They often
flit by quickly, but if you’re mindful, you can spot them. This is the
biological basis for the old saying that the eyes are the windows to the soul.

Relax. Let your body open to resonating with the other person’s

emotions.

**TRACK THE THOUGHTS OF OTHERS**

Actively imagine what the other person could be thinking and wanting.

Imagine what could be going on beneath the surface, and what might be
pulling in different directions inside him. Consider what you know or can
reasonably guess about him, such as his personal history, childhood,
temperament, personality, “hot buttons,” recent events in his life, and the
nature of his relationship with you: What effect might these have? Also take
into account what you’ve already experienced from tuning in to his actions
and emotions. Ask yourself questions, such as _What might he be feeling_
_deep down? What could be most important to him? What might he want_
_from me?_ Be respectful, and don’t jump to conclusions: stay in “don’t
know” mind.

**CHECK BACK**

As appropriate, check with the other person to see if you’re on the right

track. For example, you might say, “Sounds like you’re feeling _________,


-----

is that right?” Or, “I’m not sure, but I get the sense that _________.” Or, “It
seems like what bothered you was _________. Did you want _________?”

Be careful not to ask questions in an argumentative or prosecutorial way

to advance your own viewpoint. And don’t muddle empathy together with
any disagreements you may have. Keep empathy separate from asserting
yourself, and try to be clear about the transition from one to the other. For
example, you might say something like, “I get that you wanted more
attention from me when we visited my relatives, and that you felt bad. It
makes sense to me and I’m sorry. I’m going to be more careful about that in
the future. [Pause.] But, you know, you seemed happy chatting away with
Aunt Sue and didn’t tell me that you wanted more attention. If you could
tell me directly what you’d like in the moment, it would be easier for me to
give it to you—which is what I definitely want to do.”

**RECEIVE EMPATHY YOURSELF**

When you would like to receive empathy, remember that you’re more

likely to get it if you are “feelable.” Be open, present, and honest. You
could also ask for empathy directly; remember that some people may just
not realize that receiving empathy is important to you (and to lots of others,
too). Be willing to say explicitly what you would like to receive. It often
helps to make it clear that it’s empathy you want, not necessarily agreement
or approval. When you sense that the other person gets how it is for you, at
least in some ways, let the experience of receiving empathy sink into your
implicit, emotional memory.

## Feeling Comfortable with Closeness

Empathy opens you up to other people and naturally draws you closer. So to
be as empathic as possible, you need to be comfortable with closeness. But
this can be challenging. During our evolutionary history, there were many
risks in encounters with others. Additionally, most psychological pain
occurs in close relationships—particularly those in early childhood, when
memory networks are most easily shaped and emotional reactions are least
regulated by the PFC. All in all, it’s natural to be wary about getting too


-----

close. The methods below can help you feel safer while becoming more
deeply connected with other people.

**Focus on Your Internal Experience**

There appears to be a central network in the middle and lower regions of

the brain that evolved to integrate multiple social-emotional capabilities
(Siegel 2007). This network is stimulated by important relationships,
especially their emotional aspects. Depending somewhat on your
temperament (some of us are more affected by relationships than others),
you might feel flooded by all the information flowing through this network.
To deal with this, focus more on your own experience than on the other
person (e.g., track some breaths in and out, or wiggle your toes and pay
attention to the sensations). Notice how you keep going on being, doing just
fine even though you are emotionally close. This reduces the sense of threat
from closeness and thus the desire to pull back.

**Pay Attention to Awareness Itself**

Pay attention to awareness itself, distinct from the (potentially intense)

sense of the other person contained within awareness; simply notice that
you’re aware and explore what that’s like. Technically, the working memory
aspects of awareness appear to be based largely on neural substrates in the
_dorsolateral_ (upper-outer) portions of the PFC, in contrast to the
_ventromedial_ (lower-middle) circuitry that processes social-emotional
content. By bringing attention to awareness, you’re probably energizing
those dorsolateral circuits more than their ventromedial neighbors.

**Use Imagery**

Use imagery, which stimulates the right hemisphere of your brain. For

example, if I’m with someone who’s getting intense, I might imagine
myself as a deeply rooted tree, with the other person’s attitudes and
emotions blowing through my leaves and shaking them—but winds always
come to an end, and my tree remains standing. Or I’ll imagine that there is a


-----

picket fence between us—or, if need be, a glass wall that’s a foot thick. In
addition to the benefits that come from the particular images themselves,
activating the right hemisphere encourages a sense of the whole that is
larger than any part—including that part of your experience which might
feel uncomfortable with closeness.

**Be Mindful of Your Inner World**

Whether you’re with others or by yourself, being mindful of your inner

world seems to help heal significant shortages of empathy you may have
experienced when you were young (Siegel 2007). In essence, mindful
attention to your own experience activates many of the same circuits that
are stimulated in childhood by the attuned and caring attention of others.
Thus, you’re giving to yourself here and now what you should have gotten
when you were little; over time, this interest and concern will gradually sink
in, helping you feel more secure while being close with others.

## May You Not Suffer

You can deliberately cultivate compassion, which will stimulate and
strengthen its underlying neural substrate, including your ACC and insula
(Lutz, Brefczynski-Lewis, et al. 2008). To prime the neural circuits of
compassion, bring to mind the feeling of being with someone who loves
you, while calling up heartfelt emotions such as gratitude or fondness. Next,
bring empathy to the difficulties of the other person. Opening to his (even
subtle) suffering, let sympathy and goodwill naturally arise. (These steps
flow together in actual practice.)

Then, in your mind, offer explicit wishes, such as _May you not suffer._

_May you find rest. May it go well with the doctor._ Or wordlessly experience
compassionate feelings and wishes. You could also focus on universal,
nonreferential compassion—compassion which has no particular target—so
that, as Tibetan monk Mathieu Ricard says,“benevolence and compassion
pervade the mind as a way of being” (Lutz, Brefczynski-Lewis, et al. 2008,
e1897).


-----

You can also bring compassion practices into meditation. In the

beginning, make your compassionate phrases the object of attention. As the
meditation deepens, sink into feeling compassion beyond words, the sense
of it filling your heart and chest and body, becoming increasingly absorbing
and intense. You may feel compassion radiating from you in all directions:
front and back, left and right, up and down.

However and whenever you experience compassion, be mindful of the

experience and really take it in. By remembering what it’s like, you’ll be
more able to return to this lovely state of mind in the future.

Every day, try to have compassion for five kinds of people: someone

you’re grateful to (a “benefactor”), a loved one or friend, a neutral person,
someone who is difficult for you—and yourself. For example, sometimes
I’ll look at a stranger on the street (a neutral person), get a quick sense of
him or her, and then access a sense of compassion. You can also bring
compassion to animals and plants, or toward groups of people (e.g.,
children, those who are ill, Republicans or Democrats). Compassion is for
_everyone._

Even though it can be hard to bring compassion to a difficult person,

doing so reinforces the important lesson that we are all one in our suffering.
When you see how connected everything is, and the many factors
“upstream” that push on every person, compassion naturally arises. The
Buddhist image of this is the jewel of compassion resting in the lotus of
wisdom—the union of caring and insight.

## Asserting Yourself

Being assertive means speaking your truth and pursuing your aims in the
nitty-gritty of relationships. In my experience, skillful assertiveness is
founded on _unilateral virtue_ and _effective communication_ . Let’s see what
this actually means, whether interacting with a friend, coworker, lover, or
family member.

**Unilateral Virtue**


-----

Virtue sounds lofty, but it’s actually down to earth. It simply means living

from your innate goodness, guided by principle. When you are virtuous no
matter what other people do, their behavior is not controlling you. As a
therapist, I’ve seen many couples in which each person says essentially the
same thing: _I’ll treat you well after you treat me well._ They’re stuck in a
standoff—which neither one of them truly wants—because they’re each
letting the other person determine their behavior.

On the other hand, when you are unilaterally virtuous, you head directly

toward your own enlightened self-interest whether or not the other person
cooperates. It feels good to be good, enjoying “the bliss of blamelessness”
with a mind untroubled by guilt or regret. Staying principled fosters inner
peace by reducing wrangles that would otherwise weigh on your mind. It
increases the odds that others will treat you well in return. If need be, it sets
you on the moral high ground.


Doing the right thing draws on both head and heart. Your prefrontal

cortex (“head”) forms values, makes plans, and gives instructions to the rest
of the brain. Your limbic system (“heart”) fuels the inner strength you use to
do the right thing when it’s hard, and supports heart-centered virtues such as
courage, generosity, and forgiveness. Even seemingly “heady” moral
reasoning draws heavily on emotional processing; consequently, people
with damage to the limbic system have a hard time making certain ethical
decisions (Haidt 2007).

Virtue in the mind is supported by regulation in the brain. Both of these

involve finding an equilibrium that is centered around healthy core aims,
stays in bounds, and changes smoothly rather than abruptly or chaotically.
To find that place of balance for yourself, let’s apply the nature of a healthy


-----

equilibrium to virtue. Then you’ll develop your own “code.” Throughout
this exploration, keep listening to both your head and your heart for what it
would mean to assert yourself virtuously.

**AN EQUILIBRIUM OF VIRTUE**

First, identify your core aims. What are your purposes and principles in

relationships? For example, one fundamental moral value is not to harm
people, including yourself. If your needs are not being met in a relationship,
that’s harmful to you. If you are mean or punishing, that harms others.
Another potential aim might be to keep discovering the truth about yourself
and the other person.

Second, stay in bounds. The Wise Speech section of Buddhism’s Noble

Eightfold Path offers good guidelines for communication that stays within
the lines: _Say only what is well-intended, true, beneficial, timely, expressed_
_without harshness or malice, and—ideally—what is wanted._ Several years
ago I took up the precept of never speaking or acting out of anger. I must
have violated it that first day in a dozen little ways, with exasperation,
sarcasm, eye rolls, sniffs, whatever. But over time it’s become more
ingrained, and a very powerful practice. It forces a person to slow down in
interactions, to avoid making matters worse by pouring the gasoline of
anger on a smoldering fire, and to feel down below your the anger for the
real issue (e.g., hurt, worry, guilt). Afterward, you feel good about yourself:
you stayed in control and didn’t add your own reactivity to a tense situation.
Of course, the principle of staying in bounds applies to others, too. If
someone violates your boundaries—for example, by treating you
disrespectfully, or continuing to yell at you after you say you want it to stop
—that pushes the equilibrium of your relationship out of bounds, and your
code can certainly include not putting up with that. (We’ll explore how to
stand up for yourself in the section below on effective communication.)

Third, change smoothly. In a series of studies (1995), psychologist John

Gottman documented the value of a slow start-up when discussing
potentially upsetting matters with another person. As I’ve learned myself,
that usually works a lot better than doing things like walking in the front
door and immediately criticizing your partner for having all the lights on.
Rapid, abrupt actions trigger alarms in the other person’s SNS/HPAA
system, which shake a relationship like poking a sleeping cat with a sharp


-----

stick. Small but skillful steps prevent these herky-jerky shifts—steps, such
as asking if this is a good time to talk before diving in full steam, or not
curtly cutting off a conversation that’s striking too close to home.

**PERSONAL CODE**

Now write your personal code of unilateral relationship virtues. This

could be a handful of words. Or more extensive dos and don’ts. Whatever
its form, aim for language that is powerful and motivating, that makes sense
to your head and touches your heart. It doesn’t have to be perfect to be
useful, and you can always revise it later. For example, it might include
statements like these:

_Listen more, talk less._
_Don’t yell or threaten other people, and don’t let them do that to me._
_Every day, ask my wife three questions in a row about how things_
_are going for her._
_Get home by six every night to have dinner with the family._
_Say what I need._
_Be loving._
_Keep my promises._

When you’re done, visualize yourself acting according to your code no

matter what happens. Imagine the good feelings and other rewards that this
will bring you. Take these in to help motivate yourself to truly live by your
code. Then, when you do live by it and things go well, take that in, too.

## Effective Communication

Lots can be said about how to communicate effectively. From thirty-plus
years of working with people as a therapist or management consultant—and
some painful lessons as a husband and father—I consider these the key
points:

Stay in touch with your deeper feelings and wants. The mind is like
a giant parfait, with softer, child-like, and more essential layers
under harder, adult-like, and more superficial ones. Based on this


-----

inner mindfulness, keep clarifying your aims in the interaction. For
example, do you just want to be listened to? Is there something in
particular you want to be sure will never happen again?
Take responsibility for getting your needs met in the relationship.
Stay focused on the prize, whatever it is for you, and keep coming
back to it. If the other person has important topics of his own, often
it works best to take turns, focusing on one topic at a time, rather
than mixing them together.
Communicate primarily for yourself, not to produce a particular
response from the other person. Sure, it’s reasonable to hope for
some good results over there. But if you communicate in order to
fix, change, or convince another person, the success of your
communications will depend on how she reacts to you, and then it’s
out of your hands. Plus, the other person is likely to be more open to
you if she doesn’t feel pressed to change in some way.
Stay guided by your personal code. At the end of the day, what you
and the other person will mainly remember is not what you said but
_how_ you said it. Be careful about your tone, and avoid language that
is fault-finding, exaggerated, or inflammatory.
When you speak, keep coming back to your own experience—
notably, your emotions, body sensations, and underlying hopes and
wishes—rather than talking about events, such as the other person’s
actions, and your opinions about them. No one can argue with your
experience; it is what it is, and you are the world’s expert on it.
When you share your experience, take responsibility for it, and don’t
blame the other person for it. As appropriate, convey its deeper
layers, such as the longings for love that lie beneath jealousy. Even
though this openness is often scary, the deeper layers contain what’s
most vital to get at for both you and the other person. The
universality of these layers and their relatively unthreatening nature
also increase the chance that the other person will lower his guard
and hear what you have to say. I highly recommend the approach
Marshall Rosenberg details in _Nonviolent Communication_ (2 nd

Edition 2008), which has essentially three parts: _When X happens_

[described factually, not judgmentally], _I feel Y_ [especially the
deeper, softer emotions] _, because I need Z_ [fundamental needs and
wants].


-----

Try to experience your truth as you speak it. This will increase your
inner mindfulness, and probably also help the other person
empathize with you. Notice any tightness in the eyes, throat, chest,
belly, or floor of the pelvis, and see if you can relax it to allow your
experience to flow more freely.
Use the power of embodied emotion: take the physical stance of a
feeling or attitude—which might not be your usual posture—to aid
the expression of it (Niedenthal 2007). For example, if you typically
hold back, try talking while leaning slightly forward; if you tend to
push away sadness, soften your eyes; if you find it hard to be
assertive, shift your shoulders to open your chest.
If you think you might get triggered by the interaction and lose your
way, help your prefrontal cortex to help you—an interesting
circularity!—by sorting out your key points in advance, even
writing them down. To keep your words and tone clean, imagine a
video recording being made of your interaction: act so that you
wouldn’t wince if you saw it.
If you are solving a problem with someone, establish the facts (if
you can). This usually narrows the disagreement and brings in
useful information. But mainly focus on the future, not the past.
Most quarrels are about the past: what happened, how bad it was,
who said what, how it was said, extenuating circumstances, and so
on. Instead, try to agree about how things will be _from now on._ Be
as clear as possible. If it helps, write it down. Tacitly or explicitly,
you are making agreements with each other that should be taken as
seriously as commitments at work.
Take maximum reasonable responsibility for the other person’s
issues with you. Identify what there is to correct on your part, and
correct it unilaterally—even if that person keeps blowing it with
you. One by one, keep crossing off her legitimate complaints. It’s
fine to put some attention on trying to influence her behavior, but
focus mainly on being honorable, benevolent, and increasingly
skillful yourself. This is definitely the road less traveled, but it’s the
one that’s both kind and smart. You can’t control how she treats you,
but you _can_ control how you treat her: these are the causes you can
actually tend to. And doing what’s right regardless of her behavior is
a good way to encourage her to treat you well.


-----

Give it time. As time passes—weeks and months, not years—the
truth about the other person will become clearer. For example: Does
he respect your boundaries? Will he keep agreements? Can he repair
misunderstandings? What is his learning curve for selfunderstanding and interpersonal skills (appropriate to the type of
relationship)? What are his true intentions (revealed over time by his
actions)?
When you see another person clearly, sometimes you realize that the
relationship needs to change to match what you can actually count
on. This goes two ways: a relationship that’s bigger than its real
foundation is a set-up for disappointment and hurt, while a
relationship that’s smaller than its foundation is a lost opportunity.
In both cases, focus on your own initiative, especially after you’ve
made reasonable efforts to encourage changes in the other person.

For example, you usually can’t make a coworker stop being dismissive

of you, but you can “shrink” the relationship—so it’s closer to the
size of its true foundation—by minimizing your contacts with him,
doing an excellent job on your own, building up alliances with other
people, and arranging for the quality of your work to be seen widely.
Conversely, if there is a large foundation of love in your marriage
but your mate is not that emotionally nurturing, you can try to
“grow” the relationship on your own by paying particular attention
to when he expresses caring through his actions and soaking that
into your heart, by drawing him into situations with a culture of
warmth (e.g., dinner with friends, certain kinds of live music,
meditation group), and perhaps by being more emotionally nurturing
yourself.

Throughout all of this, keep in mind the big picture, the 1,000-foot
view. See the impermanence of whatever is at issue, and the many
causes and conditions that led to it. See the collateral damage—the
suffering—that results when you cling to your desires and opinions
or take things personally. Over the long haul, most of what we argue
about with others really doesn’t matter that much.
Above all, try to preserve your fundamental orientation of
compassion and kindness. You can differ vigorously with people
while simultaneously holding them in your heart. For example,


-----

bearing in mind all that has happened in Tibet since it was invaded
in 1950, consider how the Dalai Lama has spoken of the Chinese
government as: _my friend, the enemy_ (Brehony 2001, 217) _._ Or
consider Nelson Mandela, imprisoned for twenty-seven years—
much of that time doing hard labor in a quarry—often receiving
mail just once every six months. It’s said that he despaired of losing
contact with people he loved, so he decided to bring love to his
guards while continuing to stand firm in his opposition to apartheid.
It was hard for the guards to mistreat him when he was being loving,
so the authorities had to keep replacing them, but Mandela would
just love the new ones, too. In fact, at his inauguration as president
of South Africa, one of his former guards was seated in the front
row.

## chapter 9: Key Points

Compassion is concern for the suffering of beings (including
yourself). Assertion is expressing your truth and pursuing your aims
within any type of relationship. These two work together.
Compassion infuses warmth and caring into your assertiveness.
Assertiveness helps you stick up for yourself and others, and to feel
confident that you can still get your needs met even while being
compassionate.
Empathy is the basis of true compassion, since it makes you aware
of the difficulties others face and their suffering. Empathy supports
relationships in other ways as well, such as by helping you
understand another person’s inner workings. Empathic breakdowns
are upsetting. When they happen frequently with vulnerable people
such as children, they can be very harmful.
Empathy involves simulating the actions, feelings, and thoughts of
another person. Simulate her actions through imagining what it
would feel like in your body to do them. Simulate her feelings
through tuning into your own emotions and watching her face and
eyes closely. Simulate her thoughts by taking into account what you
know about her, and by forming good guesses about her inner
world.


-----

Being comfortable with closeness supports empathy and

compassion. Nonetheless, humanity’s evolutionary heritage (in
which the greatest threats usually came from other people),
combined with personal life experiences (especially childhood
ones), can make an individual uncomfortable with closeness. Ways
to increase comfort with closeness include focusing on your internal
experience instead of on the other person, paying attention to
awareness itself, using imagery, and being mindful of your inner
world.
Compassion draws on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and
insula. Through cultivating compassion, you can strengthen the
circuitry in these regions.
Compassion is supported by recalling the feeling of being with
someone who loves you, evoking heartfelt emotions such as
gratitude, being empathic, opening to the suffering of other beings,
and wishing them well. Bring compassion to five kinds of people:
benefactors, friends, neutral people, difficult people, and yourself.
Asserting yourself skillfully involves unilateral virtue and effective
communication. Virtue means living from your innate goodness,
guided by principle. Virtue in your mind rests on regulation in your
brain; both virtue and regulation require maintaining a balance that
is centered around healthy aims, stays within a healthy range, and
changes smoothly.
After considering your aims in relationships, what it means to stay
in bounds, and how to interact harmoniously with others, establish
your personal code of relationship virtues. Living by this code
unilaterally—no matter what others do—increases your

independence and self-control in relationships, feels good in its own
right, puts you on the moral high ground, and is your best-odds
strategy for evoking good behavior from others.
Key points for effective communication include: focus on speaking
your truth rather than changing other people; stay in touch with your
experience, especially the deeper layers; establish the facts; take
maximum reasonable responsibility for the other person’s issues
with you and keep addressing his or her legitimate complaints; do
what you can to have the relationship match its true foundation;


-----

keep in mind the big picture; and maintain compassion and
kindness.

## chapter 10

# Boundless Kindness

_All joy in this world comes from wanting others to be happy, and all_

_suffering in this world comes from wanting only oneself to be happy._

—Shantideva

If compassion is the wish that beings not suffer, kindness is the wish that
they be happy. Compassion responds primarily to suffering, but kindness
comes into play all of the time, even when others are doing fine. Kindness
is expressed mainly in small, everyday ways, such as leaving a big tip,
reading one more story to a child even though you’re tired, or waving
another driver to move ahead of you in traffic.

Kindness has a loving quality, thus the term _loving-kindness_ . Loving-

kindness ranges from the casual helpfulness of strangers to the profound
love one has for a child or mate. The words “kind” and “kin,” share the
same root; kindness brings people into the circle of “us” and feeds the wolf
of love.

Kindness depends on prefrontal intentions and principles, limbic-based

emotions and rewards, neurochemicals such as oxytocin and endorphins,
and brain stem arousal. These factors offer you a variety of ways to nurture
your kindness, which we’ll explore in this chapter.

## Wishing Others Well

I often work with children and have spent a lot of time in schools. I really
like these guidelines I once saw posted in a kindergarten: _Be nice. Share_
_your toys._ These are excellent intentions to be kind—and you don’t need
much more than them to steer your life!


-----

Every morning, establish the intention to be kind and loving that day.

Imagine the good feelings that will come from treating people with
kindness; take in these feelings as rewards that will naturally draw your
mind and brain toward kindness. The results could ripple far and wide.

One way to focus and express kind intentions is through these traditional

wishes, which you can think, write down, or even sing:

_May you be safe._
_May you be healthy._
_May you be happy._
_May you live with ease._

You can modify these if you like, using whatever words evoke strong
feelings of kindness and love in you. For example:

_May you be safe from inner and outer harm._
_May your body be strong and vital._
_May you truly be at peace._
_May you and everyone you love prosper._
_May you be safe, healthy, happy, and at ease._

You can also be very specific:

_May you get that job you want._
_Susan, may your mother treat you well._
_May you get a hit at Little League today, Carlo._
_May I be at peace with my daughter._

Loving-kindness practice is like compassion practice in several ways. It

involves both wishes and feelings; in your brain, loving-kindness mobilizes
prefrontal language and intention networks as well as limbic emotion and
reward networks. It calls on equanimity to keep the heart open, especially in
the face of great pain or provocation. Kindness is for everyone—“omitting
none,” in the traditional phrase—with all beings held as “us” in your heart.
There are five types of people you can offer kindness to: benefactors,
friends, neutral people, difficult people, and yourself. When you are kind to
someone else, you also benefit yourself; it feels good to be kind, and it
encourages others to treat you well in turn.


-----

You can even be kind to parts of yourself. For example, it’s touching and

powerful to be kind to the little child within you. You could also be kind to
aspects of yourself that you wish were different, such as a craving for
attention, a learning disability, or a fear of certain situations.

**Loving-Kindness Meditation**

You can meditate on loving-kindness itself; it has a warm feeling to it

that is “juicier” than the breath and thus, for many people, easier to keep
paying attention to. One practice is to express your kind wishes as specific
phrases—such as the ones in the previous section—and then say them in
your mind one by one, perhaps in rhythm with the breath (e.g., one phrase
per breath). Or you can use the phrases more as a gentle guide, returning to
them if your attention wanders. All the while, keep settling into the feeling
of loving-kindness, in which there is boundless goodwill, generosity, and
cherishing. You can use loving-kindness for deepening concentration:
instead of becoming absorbed in the breath, you sink into loving-kindness.
Meanwhile, loving-kindness is sinking into you; keep taking it into implicit
memory, weaving its lovely threads into the fabric of your being.

When you try to offer loving-kindness to those in the category of

“difficult people,” it’s natural to find this a challenge. First, establish some
calm, stability, and spaciousness in your mind. Then work your way into it,
starting with a person who is only mildly difficult for you, such as a
coworker who’s a little annoying but also has a lot of good qualities.

**Kindness in Daily Life**

Throughout the day, deliberately and actively bring kindness into your

actions, your speech, and most of all, your thoughts. Try to encourage more
themes of kindness in the mini-movies running in the background of your
mind, in the simulator. As the simulator’s neural networks increasingly
“fire” with messages of kindness, that feeling and stance toward others will
become more “wired” into your brain.

Try experiments in which you bring loving-kindness to someone for a

specific period of time—perhaps a family member for an evening, or a


-----

coworker during a meeting—and see what happens. Also act kindly toward
yourself—and see what that’s like! My teacher, Jack Kornfield, sometimes
encourages people to do a year of loving-kindness toward themselves,
which is a powerful practice.

**A Call to Love**

Across all faiths and traditions, every great teacher has asked us to be

loving and kind. Loving-kindness is not about being nice in some
sentimental or superficial way: it is a fearless, passionate cherishing of
everyone and everything, omitting none. Love is the jewel in the lotus, and
it’s just as important as wisdom. Love is a profound path of practice in its
own right, as seen in the Buddha’s reference to “the liberation of mind by
loving-kindness.”

## Turning Ill Will to Goodwill

Kindness is relatively easy when others treat you well, or at least don’t
harm you. The acid test is to find your way to kindness even when you’ve
been mistreated. The Jataka Tales describe the Buddha’s (supposed) past
lives as different animals, when animals could talk. For an example of
unconditional loving-kindness, I’ve adapted a story in which he’s a gorilla:

_One day a hunter came into the forest, got lost, fell down a_

_deep hole, and couldn’t climb out. He called for days,_
_growing hungrier and weaker. Finally the Buddha-gorilla_
_heard him and came. Seeing the steep and slippery sides of_
_the hole, the gorilla told the man, “To carry you out safely,_
_first I’m going to roll boulders down and practice on them.”_

_The gorilla rolled several boulders into the hole, each one_

_bigger than the last, and carried them all out. Finally he was_
_ready for the man. After struggling upward, pulling at rocks_
_and vines, he pushed the man out, and with his last strength,_
_crawled out himself._


-----

_The man looked around, very happy to be out of the hole._

_The gorilla lay beside him, panting. The man said, “Thank_
_you, Gorilla. Can you guide me out of this forest?” The_
_gorilla replied, “Yes, Man, but first I must sleep for awhile to_
_get my strength back.”_

_As the gorilla slept, the man watched him and began to_

_think: “I am very hungry. I can find my way out of this forest_
_on my own. This is just an animal. I could drop one of these_
_boulders on its head, kill it, and eat it. Why don’t I do that?”_

_So the man lifted up one of the boulders as high as he_

_could, and threw it down hard on the gorilla’s head. The_
_gorilla cried out in pain and sat up quickly, stunned by the_
_blow, blood pouring down his face. As the gorilla looked at_
_the man and realized what had happened, tears gathered in_
_his eyes. He shook his head in sorrow and said, “Poor Man._
_Now you’ll never be happy.”_


**Reflections on Goodwill and Ill Will**

This story has always touched me deeply. It gives us a lot to think about:

Goodwill and ill will are about intention: the _will_ is for good or ill.
The gorilla intended to be helpful, and the man intended to kill.
These intentions are expressed through action and inaction, word
and deed, and—especially—thoughts. How do you feel when you
sense another person taking potshots at you in her mind? What does
it feel like to take potshots of your own? Ill will plays a lot of minimovies in the simulator, those little grumbling stories about other


-----

people. Remember: while the movie is running, your neurons are
wiring together.
Ill will tries to justify itself: _This is just an animal._ In the moment,
the rationalizations sound plausible, like the whisperings of
Wormtongue in _The Lord of the Rings._ Only later do we realize how
we have tricked ourselves.
The gorilla’s loving-kindness was its own reward. He was not
burdened with anger or hatred. The first dart landed in the form of a
boulder; there was no need to add insult to injury with a second dart
of ill will.
No need either, for the gorilla to seek retribution. He knew that the
man would never be happy as a result of his actions. Stephen Gaskin
(2005) describes karma as hitting golf balls in a shower. Often our
attempts at payback just get in the way of balls already ricocheting
back toward the person who sent them flying in the first place.
Letting go of ill will does not mean passivity, silence, or allowing
yourself or others to be harmed. The gorilla was not cowed by the
man, and he named what was there to be named. There is plenty of
room for speaking truth to power and for effective action without
succumbing to ill will. Think of Mahatma Ghandi or Martin Luther
King, Jr. In fact, with a clear mind and a peaceful heart, your actions
are likely to be more effective.

**Taming the Wolf of Hate**

Here are numerous methods for cultivating goodwill and abandoning ill

will. You’ll be naturally drawn to some more than others. The point isn’t to
do all of them, but to know that you have lots of different ways to tame the
wolf of hate.

**CULTIVATE POSITIVE EMOTIONS**

In general, really nourish and develop positive emotions such as

happiness, contentment, and peacefulness. For example, look for things to
be happy about, and take in the good whenever possible. Positive feelings
calm the body, quiet the mind, create a buffer against stress, and foster
supportive relationships—all of which reduce ill will.


-----

**BE AWARE OF THE PRIMING**

Be mindful of factors that stimulate your sympathetic nervous system—

such as stress, pain, worry, or hunger—and thus prime you for ill will. Try
to defuse this priming early on: eat dinner before talking, take a shower,
read something inspiring, or talk with a friend.

**PRACTICE NONCONTENTION**

Don’t argue unless you have to. Inside your own mind, try not to get

swirled along by the mind-streams of other people. Reflect on the
neurological turbulence underlying their thoughts: the incredibly
complicated, dynamic, and largely arbitrary churning of momentary neural
assemblies into coherence and then chaos. Getting upset about somebody’s
thoughts is like getting upset about spray from a waterfall. Try to decouple
your thoughts from the other person’s. Tell yourself: _She’s over there and_
_I’m over here. Her mind is separate from my mind._

**BE CAREFUL ABOUT ATTRIBUTING INTENTIONS**

Be cautious about attributing intentions to other people. Prefrontal

theory-of-mind networks attribute intentions routinely, but they are often
wrong. Most of the time you are just a bit player in other people’s dramas;
they are not targeting you in particular. Consider this parable from the
Taoist teacher, Chuang Tzu (which I’ve updated):

Imagine that you are relaxing in a canoe on a river, when

suddenly there is a hard thump against the side of it,
dumping you into the water. You come up sputtering, and see
that two teenagers with snorkels have snuck up and tipped
you over. How do you feel?

Next imagine that everything is the same—the canoe, the

sudden dumping into the river—except this time when you
come up sputtering, you see that a huge submerged log has
drifted downstream and smacked into your canoe. Now how
do you feel?


-----

For most people, the second scenario doesn’t feel as bad: the first dart

still landed (you’re dumped in the river), but there is no need for second
darts in the form of hurt and anger from feeling picked on personally. Truly,
many people are like logs: it’s wise to get out of their way if you can—or
reduce the impact—but they’re not _aiming_ at you. Consider, too, the many
factors upstream that have led them to do whatever they’ve done (see the
Ten Thousand Things exercise).

## The Ten Thousand Things

Do this exercise at whatever pace you like, with your eyes open or closed.

_Relax and steady the mind, focusing on the breath._

_Pick a situation in which you feel someone has wronged you. Be mindful of_
_your reactions to this person, especially the deeper ones. Scan yourself for_
_any ill will._

_Now reflect on some of the various causes—the ten thousand things—that_
_have led this person to act in the way that he has._

_Consider biologically based factors affecting him, like pain, age, innate_
_temperament, or intelligence._

_Consider the realities of his life: race, gender, class, job, responsibilities,_
_daily stresses._

_Consider whatever you know about his childhood. Consider major events in_
_his life as an adult._

_Consider his mental processes, personality, values, fears, hot buttons,_
_hopes, and dreams._

_Consider his parents in light of whatever you know or can reasonably guess_
_about them; consider, too, the factors that may have shaped their lives._

_Reflect on the historical events and other upstream forces that have formed_
_the river of causes flowing through his life today._

_Look inside yourself again. Do you feel any differently now about him? Do_
_you feel any differently about yourself?_


-----

**BRING COMPASSION TO YOURSELF**

As soon as you feel mistreated, bring compassion to yourself—this is

urgent care for the heart. Try putting your hand on your cheek or heart to
stimulate the embodied experience of receiving compassion.

**INVESTIGATE THE TRIGGERS**

Inspect the underlying trigger of your ill will, such as a sense of threat or

alarm. Look at it realistically. Are you exaggerating what happened in any
way? Are you focusing on a single negative thing amidst a dozen good
ones?

**PUT THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE**

Put whatever happened in perspective. The effects of most events fade

with time. They’re also part of a larger whole, the great majority of which is
usually fine.

**PRACTICE GENEROSITY**

Use things that aggravate you as a way to practice generosity. Consider

letting people have what they took: their victory, their bit of money or time,
their one-upping. Be generous with forbearance and patience.

**REGARD ILL WILL AS AN AFFLICTION**

Approach your own ill will as an affliction upon _yourself_ so that you’ll be

motivated to drop it. Ill will feels bad and has negative health
consequences; for example, regular hostility increases the risk of
cardiovascular disease. Your ill will always harms you, but often it has no
effect on the other person; as they say in twelve-step programs: _Resentment_
_is when I take poison and wait for you to die._

**STUDY ILL WILL**

Take a day and really examine even the least bit of ill will you

experience. See what causes it and what its effects are.


-----

**SETTLE INTO AWARENESS**

Settle into awareness, observing ill will but not identifying with it,

watching it arise and disappear like any other experience.

**ACCEPT THE WOUND**

Life includes getting wounded. Accept as a fact that people will

sometimes mistreat you, whether accidentally or deliberately. Of course,
this doesn’t mean enabling others to harm you, or failing to assert yourself.
You’re just accepting the facts on the ground. Feel the hurt, the anger, the
fear, but let them flow through you. Ill will can become a way to avoid
facing your deep feelings and pain.

**RELAX THE SENSE OF SELF**

Relax the sense of self. Experiment with letting go of the idea that there

was actually an “I” or “me” who was affronted or wounded (see chapter
13).

**MEET MISTREATMENT WITH LOVING-KINDNESS**

Traditionally, loving-kindness is considered the direct antidote to ill will,

so resolve to meet mistreatment with loving-kindness. No matter what. A
famous sutra in Buddhism sets a high standard: “Even if bandits were to
sever you savagely limb by limb with a two-handled saw…you should train
thus: ‘Our minds will remain unaffected, and we shall utter no evil words;
we shall abide compassionate for their welfare, with a mind of lovingkindness, without inner hate’” (Nanamoli and Bodhi 1995, 223).

Personally, I’m not there yet, but if it’s possible to stay loving while

being horribly mistreated—and from some of the accounts of people in
awful circumstances, it clearly is—then we should be able to rise up in
lesser situations, like getting cut off in traffic or being put down yet again
by a teenager.

**COMMUNICATE**


-----

To the extent that it’s useful, speak your truth and stick up for yourself

with skillful assertiveness. Your ill will is telling you something. The art is
to understand its message—perhaps that another person is not a true friend,
or that you need to be clearer about your boundaries—without being swept
away by anger.

**HAVE FAITH IN JUSTICE**

As in the story of the gorilla above, have faith that others will pay their

own price one day for what they’ve done. You don’t have to be the justice
system.

**DON’T TEACH LESSONS IN ANGER**

Realize that some people won’t get the lesson no matter how much you

try. So why create problems for yourself in a pointless effort to teach them?

**FORGIVE**

Forgiveness doesn’t mean changing your view that wrongs have been

done. But it does mean letting go of the emotional charge around feeling
wronged. The greatest beneficiary of your forgiveness is usually you. (For
more on this subject, see _The Art of Forgiveness, Lovingkindness, and_
_Peace_ by Jack Kornfield and _Forgive for Good_ by Fred Luskin.)

## Loving-Kindness for the Whole World

In light of our ancient tendency to collapse the field of love to a small circle
of “us” surrounded by “them,” it’s good to cultivate the habit of pushing
that circle out—widening it ultimately to include the whole world. Here are
some suggestions for doing so.

**Expanding the Category of “Us”**

Be mindful of the automatic mental processes that cause you to identify

with a particular group (e.g., gender, race, religion, sexual orientation,


-----

political party, nation), and then regard members of different groups as
_others_ . Focus on similarities between “us” and “them,” not differences.
Recognize that everything is connected to everything else, that “us” is the
whole wide world—that, in a deep sense, the entire planet is your home and
the people on it is are your extended family. Deliberately create mental
categories that include you along with people you usually regard as not-me;
for example, when you see someone in a wheelchair, think about how we
are all disabled in one way or another.

Be particularly mindful of the default processes of valuing your own

group while devaluing others (Efferson, Lalive, and Feh 2008). Notice how
often that valuing actually has no rational basis. Be aware of the little ways
that your mind regards others as less of a person than you—as an “It” to
your “I.” Focus on the good things about people in other groups. Regard
people more as individuals than as representatives of a group, which
reduces prejudice (Fiske 2002).

**Reducing the Sense of Threat**

Be mindful of any sense of threat. This feeling evolved to protect us in

environments that were much more dangerous than anything most of us
face today. In reality, how likely is it that other people will actually harm
you?

**Mutual Benefit**

Look for opportunities for cooperative exchanges with members of other

groups (e.g., sharing child care, doing business). When people depend on
each other for their welfare, and come to experience each other as reliable
and honorable, it’s a lot harder to see each other as enemies.

**Warming the Heart**

Reflect on the suffering so many people endure. Reflect, too, on what

others may have been like as young children—this will activate the warmth
and goodwill we naturally feel toward little kids.


-----

Remember the feeling you get around someone who loves you, which

stimulates your capacities to care about others. Next, call to mind the
experience of really caring about someone who is an “us” to you; that
primes your neural circuits to care about someone who could be a “them.”
Then extend the sense of “us” to include every living being on our planet—
as in the meditation on loving-kindness on the next page.

## A Meditation on Loving-Kindness

Here is an extended meditation on loving-kindness:

_Find a posture that helps you remain relaxed and alert. Settle into the_
_breath. Establish some equanimity, some mental spaciousness and balance._

_Be aware of the sensations of the breath in the region of the heart. Bring to_
_mind the feeling of being with someone you love._

_Keep feeling that love. Sense that love flowing through your heart, perhaps_
_in a rhythm with the breath. Feel how that love has a life of its own, flowing_
_through your heart, not specific to any one person._

_Sense your love toward the people you know well, your friends and family._
_Feel a generous loving-kindness flowing through your heart in rhythm with_
_the breath._

_Feel that loving-kindness extending farther outward, toward the many_
_people you know who are neutral to you. Wish them the best, too. Wish that_
_they suffer less. That they be truly happy._

_You may sense this loving-kindness like a warmth or light. Or like a_
_spreading pool, with gentle waves extending farther and farther to include_
_ever more people._

_Feel your loving-kindness reaching out to include even difficult people;_
_your loving-kindness has a life and a strength of its own. Your lovingkindness understands that many factors affected these difficult people and_
_led them to be a problem for you. You wish that even people who have_
_mistreated you may suffer less. That they, too, may be truly happy._


-----

_The peacefulness and strength of this loving-kindness flows outward ever_
_farther to include people who you know exist, though you do not know them_
_personally. Sense loving-kindness for all the people living in your country_
_today, whether you agree with them or not, whether you like them or not._

_Take a few minutes to explore extending your loving-kindness to the billions_
_of people living here on earth. Loving-kindness for someone somewhere_
_laughing. Loving-kindness for someone crying. Loving-kindness for_
_someone getting married. Loving-kindness for someone caring for a sick_
_child or parent. Loving-kindness for someone worried. Loving-kindness for_
_someone being born. Loving-kindness for someone dying._

_Your loving-kindness is flowing comfortably, perhaps in rhythm with the_
_breath. Your loving-kindness is extending to all living beings on this earth._
_Wishing them all well. All kinds of animals, in the sea, on the earth, in the_
_air: may they all be healthy and at ease. Wishing well to plants of all kinds:_
_may they all be healthy and at ease. Wishing well to microorganisms of all_
_kinds, the amoebas, the bacteria, even the viruses: may every living being_
_be at ease._

_So that all beings are “us.”_

_So that all children are my own._

_All life, my relatives._

_The whole earth, my home._

## Chapter 10: Key Points

If compassion is the wish that someone not suffer, kindness is the
wish that he or she be happy. It has a loving quality to it, thus the
term “loving-kindness.” When you practice kindness, you tame the
wolf of hate and nurture the wolf of love.
There are many ways to do this; they include forming the intention
to be kind, translating this intention into specific good wishes,
meditating on loving-kindness, focusing on kindness in daily life,
and using love itself as a path of practice.


-----

It’s easy to be kind when others treat you well. The challenge is to
preserve your loving-kindness when they treat you badly—to
preserve goodwill in the face of ill will.
It helps to remember that kindness is its own reward, that
consequences often come to others without you needing to bring
justice to them yourself, and that you can be assertive without
falling into ill will.
There are many ways to turn ill will to goodwill and tame the wolf
of hate. Be careful about the intentions you attribute to others; take
fewer things personally; regard your ill will as an affliction upon
yourself that you naturally want to be relieved of; resolve to meet
mistreatment with loving-kindness; communicate and assert
yourself; and forgive.
Extend the circle of “us” to include as much of the world as you
possibly can. Be mindful of automatic categorizations into “us” and
“them” and look for ways that “them” is actually “us”; notice
whenever you feel threatened, and consider whether there are
actually any threats; consciously warm your heart toward others;
practice loving-kindness for the whole world.

# Foundations of Mindfulness

_The education of attention would be an education par excellence._

—William James

We hear the word “mindful” more and more these days, but what does it
actually mean? Being mindful simply means having good control over your
attention: you can place your attention wherever you want and it stays
there; when you want to shift it to something else, you can.

When your attention is steady, so is your mind: not rattled or hijacked by

whatever pops into awareness, but stably present, grounded, and
unshakeable. Attention is like a spotlight, and what it illuminates streams
into your mind and shapes your brain. Consequently, developing greater
control over your attention is perhaps the single most powerful way to
reshape your brain and thus your mind.

You can train and strengthen your attention just like any other mental

ability (Jha, Krompinger, and Baime 2007; Tang et al. 2007); this chapter
and the next one will show you many ways to do this. Let’s start by
exploring _how_ your brain pays attention.

## Your Mindful Brain

To help an animal survive—especially a complicated animal like us—the
brain manages the flow of attention by balancing three needs: keeping
information in mind, changing the contents of awareness, and finding the
right amount of stimulation.

**Holding onto Information**


-----

The brain must be able to keep important information in the foreground

of awareness—such as a suspicious movement in the grass of the African
savannah 100,000 years ago, or a phone number you just heard. My
dissertation advisor, Bernard Baars (1997), developed the influential theory
of a _global workspace of consciousness_ —or in plainer terms, the mental
chalkboard. Whatever you call it, it’s a space that holds incoming
information, old information retrieved from memory, and mental operations
on both.

**Updating Awareness**

Second, your brain must routinely update this chalkboard with new

information, whether it comes from the environment or from your own
mind. For example, suppose you glimpse a familiar face across a crowded
room but you just can’t place it. When you finally recall the woman’s name
—Jane Smith, a friend of a friend—you update the image of her face with
that information.

**Seeking Stimulation**

Third, your brain has a built-in desire for stimulation that likely evolved

to prod our ancestors to keep seeking food, mates, and other resources. This
need is so deep that in a sensory deprivation chamber (in which a person
floats on warm salt water in a completely dark and silent space), the brain
will sometimes start to hallucinate imagery just to have new information to
process (Lilly 2006).

**A Neural Balancing Act**

Your brain continually juggles these three aspects of attention. Let’s see

how this works.

When you hold something in mind, such as a presentation at work or the

sensations of breathing, the cortical regions that support working memory
(a key component of the mental chalkboard) are relatively stable. To keep
them this way, a kind of gate protects working memory from all of the other


-----

information coursing through the brain. When the gate is closed, you stay
focused on one thing _._ When a new stimulus comes knocking—perhaps a
startling thought, or the sound of a bird—the gate pops open _,_ allowing new
information in to update working memory. Then the gate closes behind it,
keeping out other information. (Of course, it’s actually more complicated
than this; see Buschman and Miller 2007; Dehaene, Sergent, and Changeux
2003.)

As long as the contents of working memory are moderately stimulating, a

steady stream of dopamine is produced, which keeps the gate closed. If the
stimulation decreases significantly, the pulsing of dopamine-releasing
neurons slows down, allowing the gate to open and new information to
surge in. On the other hand, a spikein the rate of dopamine release—due to
new opportunities or threats—will open the gate as well (Braver, Barch, and
Cohen 2002; Cohen, Aston-Jones, and Gilzenrat 2005; O’Reilly 2006).

It’s an ingeniously simple system that produces complex results. To use

an example adapted from Todd Braver and Jonathan Cohen (2000),
consider a monkey munching bananas in a tree. Steady eating maintains
stable dopamine levels and keeps his focus on _this_ tree. But when the
bananas start to run out, rewards and thus dopamine levels drop, and
thoughts about food in _that_ tree now push into working memory. Or, if a
friendly monkey swings onto a nearby branch, dopamine spikes from this
fresh stimulus also pop open the gate to awareness.

This dopamine-driven system interacts with another neural system—

based in the basal ganglia—that tries to balance the rewards of stimulationseeking (new food! new mates!) with its risks (exposure to predators, rivals,
and other hazards). The basal ganglia are a kind of “stimostat” that registers
the stimulation coming through the senses or from within the mind itself.
As long as the amount of stimulation remains above a certain threshold,
there’s no need to trigger stimulation-seeking. But when stimulation drops
below this threshold, the basal ganglia signal your brain to get more _now_ —
and you find yourself being provocative in a boring conversation or lost in
thought while meditating.

## Neurological Diversity


-----

People vary a lot in their tendencies with regard to holding onto
information, updating awareness, and seeking stimulation (see the
following table). For example, the normal range of temperament includes
both those who like a lot of novelty and excitement, and those who prefer
predictability and quiet. People at the high or low end of this range often
face challenges, especially in modern settings that require sustained
attention to things that may not be that interesting (e.g., in schools or
corporate offices). For instance, someone whose awareness is very easily
updated—whose gate to working memory is propped wide open—has a
hard time screening out irrelevant and distracting stimuli.

Whatever your innate inclinations may be, your attention is also

influenced by your life experiences and culture. For example, contemporary
Western culture strains and sometimes overwhelms the brain with more
information than it evolved to handle on a routine basis. Our culture also
habituates the brain to a hyper-rich stream of stimulation—consider video
games and shopping malls—so that a drop in this stream can feel dull and
boring. Essentially, modern life takes the jumpy, distractible “monkey
mind” we all started with and feeds it steroids. Against this backdrop, other
factors—such as motivation, fatigue, low blood sugar, illness, anxiety, or
depression—can also affect your attention.


-----

**What’s Your Personal Profile?**

Each of us has a personal profile of attentional capacities, shaped by

temperament, life experiences, cultural influences, and other factors. Taken
as a whole, what are the strengths and weaknesses of your attention? What
would you like to improve?

One pitfall is ignoring this profile—or worse, being ashamed of it—and

then trying to fit your personal square peg into the generic round hole.
Another pitfall is never challenging your tendencies. Between these is a
middle way in which you both adapt your work, family situation, and
spiritual practices to your own nature, and you develop better control of
your attention over time.

**Individualize Your Approach**


-----

To use contemplative practice as an example, many traditional methods

were developed in times and cultures that had relatively low stimulation
levels. But what about people today who are used to much more
stimulation, particularly those at the spirited end of the normal range of
temperament? I’ve seen people like this give up on meditation because they
just couldn’t find a way to do it that would fit with their own brain.

In terms of its innate effects—distinct from how others react to a person

— _neurological_ _diversity_ is much more significant than variations of gender,
race, or sexual orientation. If contemplative traditions are to increase the
diversity of their practitioners, they need to find more ways to welcome
diverse kinds of brains. Further, here in the West, we particularly need to
individualize contemplative practices because there is a premium—in busy,
“householder” lives—on methods that are targeted, efficient, and effective.

Whether you want to be more focused at work, while talking with your

partner, or during meditation, give yourself permission to adapt your
approach to your own nature. Be compassionate about your personal
challenges to mindfulness: they are not your fault, and the positive emotion
of compassion could increase dopamine levels and help steady your mind.

Next, consider which of the three aspects of attention is most challenging

for you: holding something in awareness, filtering out distractions, or
managing the desire for stimulation. For example: Do you get tired quickly
when you try to concentrate? Do you seem to have porous filters, so that
you get distracted by many of the sights and sounds around you? Or are you
the sort of person who needs a rich diet of stimulation? (Or some
combination of these?)

For the rest of this chapter, we’ll explore general-purpose methods for

gaining greater control over your attention. Then, in the next chapter, we’ll
use the preeminent training in mindfulness—meditation—to improve your
personal profile of attention abilities.

## Set Intentions

Use the power of your prefrontal cortex to set intentions to be more
mindful:


-----

Establish a deliberate intention at the beginning of any activity that
requires focus. Use statements such as _May my mind be steady._ Or
just call up a silent feeling of determination.
Get a bodily sense of being someone you know who is extremely
focused. That uses the empathy systems in the brain to simulate
within yourself the mindful nature of that other person.
Keep reestablishing your intentions. For example, if you’re in a
meeting, every few minutes you could resolve anew to stay focused.
One of my friends uses a little device that can be set to vibrate at
different intervals; he leaves it in his pocket and gets a discrete
wake-up call every ten minutes.
Make the intention to be attentive the default setting of your life by
developing the habit of everyday mindfulness.

## Supports for Everyday Mindfulness

Slow down.
Talk less.
When you can, do just one thing at a time. Reduce multitasking.
Focus on your breath while doing daily activities.
Relax into a feeling of calm presence with other people.
Use routine events—such as the phone ringing, going to the
bathroom, or drinking water—as “temple bells” to return you to a
sense of centeredness.
At meals, take a moment to reflect on where your food came from.
For example, if you were focusing on the wheat in a slice of bread,
you could imagine it growing in the fields and being harvested,
threshed, stored, ground into flour, baked into loaves, and shipped to
a market, all before arriving on your plate. You can go pretty far
with this in just a few seconds. You might also imagine some of the
people who helped turn this wheat into your bread, and the
equipment and technology involved, as well as our ancient ancestors
who slowly figured out how to domesticate wild grains.
Simplify your life; give up lesser pleasures for greater ones.


-----

## Stay Awake and Alert

The brain can’t be fully attentive unless it’s fully awake. Unfortunately, the
average person is sleep-deprived, getting about an hour less sleep a day than
the body really needs. Try to get enough sleep (“enough” depends on your
nature and factors such as fatigue, illness, thyroid problems, or depression).
In other words, take care of yourself. Struggling to pay attention when
you’re tired is like spurring an exhausted horse to keep running uphill.

Presuming you’re reasonably rested, several additional factors can

increase your alertness:

Sitting in an erect posture provides internal feedback to the _reticular_
_formation_ —a mesh-like network of nerves in the brain stem which
is involved with wakefulness and consciousness—telling it that you
need to stay vigilant and alert. This is a neurological reason behind a
schoolteacher’s demands to “sit up straight, class!” as well as the
classic meditation instruction to sit upright in a dignified way.
“Brighten the mind” is a traditional phrase used to describe infusing
your awareness with energy and clarity. In fact, to overcome
drowsiness, it’s sometimes suggested that you literally visualize
light. Neurologically, this “brightening” likely involves a surge of
norepinephrine throughout the brain; that neurotransmitter—also
triggered by the stress-response cascade—is a general orienting
signal that fosters alertness.
Oxygen is to the nervous system what gasoline is to your car.
Although just 2 percent of body weight, your brain uses roughly 20
percent of your oxygen. By taking several deep breaths, you
increase oxygen saturation in your blood and thus rev up your brain.

## Quiet the Mind

When the mind is quiet, fewer things bubble up to distract you and it’s
easier to remain mindful. In chapter 5 we explored ways to “cool the fires”;
these help quiet the mind through relaxing the body and calming emotions
and desires. The methods here focus on stilling the clamor of verbal thought
—that endlessly nattering voice in the back of the head.


-----

**Be Aware of the Body as a Whole**

Some parts of the brain are linked by _reciprocal inhibition_ : when one part

activates, it suppresses another one. To some extent, the left and right
hemispheres have this relationship; thus, when you stimulate the right
hemisphere by engaging the activities it specializes in, the verbal centers of
the left hemisphere are effectively shushed.

The right, visual-spatial hemisphere has the greater responsibility for

representing the state of your body, so awareness of the body can help
suppress left-brain verbal chatter. Right hemisphere activation increases
further when you sense the body as a _whole_ , which draws upon the global,
gestalt processing of that hemisphere.

To practice awareness of the whole body, start with the breath as a whole;

rather than allow attention to move as it normally does, from sensation to
sensation, try to experience your breath as a single, unified gestalt of
sensations in your belly, chest, throat, and nose. It’s normal for this unified
gestalt sensing to crumble after a second or two; when it does, just try to
recreate it. Then expand awareness to include the body as a whole, sensed
as a single perception, as one whole thing. This sense of the body as a
whole will also tend to crumble quickly, especially in the beginning; when
it does, simply restore it again, if only for a few seconds. You’ll get better at
this with practice, and will even be able to do this in the middle of everyday
settings such as meetings.

Besides its benefits for quieting the verbal mind, whole body awareness

supports _singleness of mind._ This is a meditative state in which all aspects
of experience come together as a whole and attention is very steady. As
we’ll see in the next chapter, this is one of the factors of deep contemplative
absorption.

**Hush the Verbal Centers**

Send a gentle instruction to the verbal centers, something along the lines

of _Hush, now, it’s time to relax and be quiet. There’s nothing important to_
_talk about right now. You’ll have plenty of time to talk later, throughout the_
_rest of the day._ In doing so, you use the power of prefrontal intention to bias
verbal activity toward relative quiet. When (not if, alas) the voices in the


-----

head start muttering again, repeat the instruction to them. For example: _It’s_
_not time for chatter, your yammering is a burden on me, you can talk after_
_this meeting/tax return/golf putt._ Alternately, you might occupy your brain’s
language centers with other verbal activities, such as repeating a favorite
saying, mantra, or prayer in the back of your mind.

If you like, make an appointment with yourself to let your mind really

yammer after you’re done with the activity you’re staying focused on. Be
sure to keep this appointment—it’s weirdly fun and definitely interesting to
amp up the verbal stream in your mind; it helps you see how arbitrary and
meaningless most of it is.

## Abide as Awareness Itself

As mindfulness stabilizes, you will rest more and more as awareness itself.
Awareness contains _mind-objects_ , a general term for any mental content,
including perceptions, thoughts, desires, memories, emotions, and so on.
Although mind-objects may dance busily with each other, awareness itself
is never disturbed. Awareness is a kind of screen on which mind-objects
register, like—in the Zen saying—the reflections on a pond of geese flying
overhead. But awareness is never sullied or rattled by the passing show.

In your brain, the neural patterns represented within awareness are highly

variable, but the representational capacities themselves—the basis of the
subjective experience of awareness—are generally very stable.

Consequently, resting as awareness brings a beautiful sense of inner clarity
and peace. These feelings are generally deepest in meditation, but you can
cultivate a greater sense of abiding as awareness throughout the day. Use
the following guided reflection to help you do just that.

## Resting in Awareness

_Relax, with your eyes open or closed. Settle into just being here, a peaceful_
_body breathing. Observe the sensations of your breath coming and going._
_Establish a clear sense of observing as distinct from that which is observed._


-----

_Observe the flow of mind-objects without getting drawn into them; don’t_
_chase mental carrots or struggle with sticks. Have thoughts and so on, but_
_don’t be them: don’t identify with the contents of awareness. Watch the_
_movie without stepping into the screen._

_Allow experiences to come and go without attempting to influence them._
_Likes and dislikes may arise regarding mind-objects; accept these_
_preferences as just more mind-objects. See that all mind-objects have the_
_same nature: they come and they go._

_Settle into the present moment. Drop the past and let go of the future._
_Receive each moment without trying to connect one moment to the next._
_Abide as presence, neither remembering nor planning. There is no_
_straining, no seeking for anything. Nothing to have, nothing to do, nothing_
_to be._

_Notice the gaps between mind-objects, a palpable way to discern the field of_
_awareness distinct from its contents. For example, deliberately think a_
_specific thought, such as “there is breathing,” and then observe what is_
_present immediately before and after the thought. See that there is a kind of_
_peaceful readiness, an unused capacity, a fertile vacancy._

_Notice the spacelike qualities of awareness: it is boundless, still and silent,_
_empty until something appears, vast enough to hold anything, always_
_present and reliable, and never altered by the mind-objects passing through_
_it like shooting stars. But do not mistake any concept of awareness—which_
_is just another mind-object—for awareness itself. Keep returning to simply_
_being, simply present, opening out to the infinite, without boundaries._

_Gently explore other qualities of awareness; stay with your direct_
_experience instead of conceptualizing about awareness. Is there a kind of_
_luminosity to it? Does awareness have a subtle compassion? Are mindobjects simply modifications of awareness itself?_

## chapter 11: Key Points

What flows through your attention sculpts your brain. Therefore,
controlling your attention may be the single most effective way to


-----

shape your brain, and thus your mind. You can train and strengthen
attention like any other mental ability; mindfulness is wellcontrolled attention.
Attention has three aspects to it: keeping information in awareness,
updating awareness with new information, and seeking the right
amount of stimulation.
Information is held in working memory, which has a kind of
dopamine-based gate. Steady stimulation keeps the gate closed. The
gate gets opened by either a decrease or an increase in stimulation,
which allows new information to surge into working memory,
closing the gate behind it.
Additionally, the basal ganglia seek a certain amount of stimulation.
If the stream of stimulation you’re receiving is above that amount,
all is well, but if the stream dries to a trickle, the basal ganglia signal
other parts of the brain to find more stimulation.
There is a natural range of strengths and weaknesses with these
three aspects of attention; this is one aspect of neurological
diversity. Each person has his or her own profile. It’s compassionate
and sensible both to adapt your work, home life, and spiritual
practices to your profile, and to improve your attention over time.
General-purpose ways to improve your attention include using
intention, staying awake and alert, quieting the mind, and abiding as
awareness.

# Blissful Concentration

_Penetrative insight joined with calm abiding utterly eradicates afflicted_

_states._

—Shantideva

Mindfulness brings insight and wisdom—and the best way to increase your
mindfulness is through meditation. It’s fine if you’ve never meditated
before. In businesses, schools, and hospitals here and around the world,
people are now learning meditative practices to become more productive,
pay better attention, heal faster, and feel less stressed. We’ll use meditation
to explore multiple methods for training your attention; you can apply these
methods to all sorts of nonmeditative situations as well.

## The Power of Meditation

The concentration that you gain from meditation takes the spotlight of
attention and turns it into a laser beam. Concentration is the natural ally of
insight, as you can see in this traditional Buddhist metaphor: _We find_
_ourselves in a forest of ignorance and need a sharp machete to clear a path_
_to liberating understanding; insight makes the blade sharp and_
_concentration gives it power._ The deepest levels of contemplative
concentration are valued in all traditions. For example, Buddhism’s
Eightfold Path includes Wise Concentration, which is about developing four
highly focused states of mind called _jhanas_ . (These usually take dedicated
practice to enter; this chapter is not a how-to manual for the _jhanas_ .)

**The Challenges of Meditation**


-----

Meditation is a great way to pressure test your attention in order to

strengthen it—precisely because it goes against the grain of the tendencies
we evolved to survive.

Consider _focused attention_ practices, in which you become absorbed in

some object, such as the breath. Animals that locked their attention onto
one thing for many minutes in a row, screened everything else out, and
dropped the need for stimulation—perhaps absorbed in the sunlight filtering
through the leaves—wouldn’t notice ominous slithers or shadows nearby,
and thus wouldn’t pass on their genes. _Monkey mind_ is the traditional,
critical term for skittish attention—but this is exactly what helped our
ancestors stay alive.

Or consider _open awareness_ meditation, where you practice choiceless

awareness of whatever comes to mind without becoming engaged by it; this
is equally contrary to our evolutionary nature. Sensations, emotions,
desires, and other mind-objects are _supposed_ to attract attention so you’ll
respond to them. Letting them roll by without hopping on board just isn’t
natural.

Appreciating these challenges will help bring some good humor and self-

compassion to your efforts to meditate.

**Five Factors of Concentration**

For thousands of years, people have investigated how to strengthen

attention in the laboratory of contemplative practice. For example,
Buddhism has identified five key factors for steadying the mind:

**Applied attention** —initial directing of attention to an object, such
as the beginning of the breath
**Sustained attention** —staying focused on the object of attention,
such as remaining aware of an entire inhalation from beginning to
end
**Rapture** —intense interest in the object; sometimes experienced as a
rush of blissful sensations
**Joy** —gladdening of the heart that includes happiness, contentment,
and tranquility


-----

**Singleness of mind** —unification of awareness in which everything
is experienced as a whole; few thoughts; equanimity; a strong sense
of being _present_

Building on the general supports for mindfulness covered in the previous

chapter, let’s explore how to develop the neural substrates of these five
factors. With practice, concentration naturally deepens for most people
(Lutz, Slager, et al. 2008). Whether you’re new to meditation or it’s already
an important part of your life, it’s great to know that there really are things
you can do inside your brain to steady your mind, even all the way to deep
meditative absorption.

For simplicity, we’ll refer to sitting meditation focused on the breath, but

you can adapt these suggestions to other practices (e.g., yoga, chanting) and
to other objects of attention (e.g., a mantra, loving-kindness). As your mind
becomes steadier, bring this stability and focus to other types of
contemplative practice (e.g., insight meditation, prayer, investigation of
impermanence) and to everyday activities.

The next three sections address applied and sustained attention, and the

different weaknesses people have with these. After that, we’ll explore
rapture and joy, and then singleness of mind. We’ll conclude with a guided
meditation that pulls together all five factors.

## Keeping Attention on Its Object

These suggestions will deepen your engagement with the contents of
awareness and thus help keep closed the gate to working memory
(discussed in the previous chapter):

Imagine a little guardian who watches how well you are watching
the breath and gives your attention a boost if it starts to flag. This
guardian “lives” mainly in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
which compares actual performance with a goal; the ACC is the part
of your brain that’s most involved in applying and sustaining
attention.
Draw on the language centers of your brain through counting or
noting the breath. For example, softly, in the back of your mind,


-----

count each breath from 1 to 10 and then start over. If you lose track,
just begin again with 1. (You can also count down, from 10 to 1,
starting over with 10 if you lose track.) If you’re ambitious, aim for
ten sets of ten breaths counted, a hundred in all without losing track;
if you like, start with your hands closed, straightening out a finger
for each set of ten. This can be a great way to start a meditation,
bringing your mind to a settled place quite quickly.
Alternately, gently note your experience—for example, thinking “in,
out” for each breath. If it helps, softly note other mind-objects:
“thinking,” “memory,” “worrying,” “planning,” and so on.
Deepen your involvement with the breath through bringing warmth,
fondness, and even devotion to it. Emotions for something naturally
intensify attention toward it, plus they engage the brain as a whole;
consequently, more neural networks are involved with the object of
attention.

## Filtering out Distractions

Here are some ways to preserve a relatively quiet space in your mind by
keeping out distracting intruders:

Take a few minutes at the start of meditation to open up to and
explore the sounds and other stimuli around you; do the same with
your inner world. Paradoxically, inviting distractions _in_ encourages
them to move _out_ . Dropping the second dart of resistance to them
reduces the amount of attention they get. Additionally, the brain
tends to become habituated to a steady stimulus and stops noticing it
after a while.
Also, receiving something completely often helps it to pass through
the mind more quickly. It’s like people knocking on your door: if
you ignore them, they keep at it, but when you open the door, they
come in, say their piece, and usually leave. You can help them on
their way by using the soft noting technique described above(e.g.,
“traffic noises…irritation”).Allowing something to emerge fully in
awareness enables its latent pattern of neural activity to emerge fully
as well. Message now delivered, that neural coalition no longer


-----

needs to press forward, no longer needs to compete with other
coalitions for center stage. And, having arrived and made its
communication, it will now be subject to the powerful processes that
keep trying to update working memory—which will usually wipe
the mental chalkboard clean after a while in order to make way for a
new coalition.
After the sense of distraction has diminished, refocus on your object
of attention (or on whatever meditation you’re doing). If distractions
return, you can always open to them again for a few minutes.
Alternatively, gently bat away distracting thoughts at the earliest
stages of their development and keep falling back into your breath.
You are disrupting the formation of neural coalitions before they
completely consolidate.
Remind yourself that you can think about other things later; tell
yourself you’ve made an appointment to meditate and you have to
keep it. This uses the capacity of the prefrontal cortex to exert topdown influence over the stream of perception and thought (Engel,
Fries, and Singer 2001).
Observe how everything moving through the mind is a passing
show, with transient performers endlessly bumped off the stage by
new ones. Why get caught up with one thing when you know it’ll
soon be replaced by something else?
If all else fails, make the distraction itself the object of attention for
this meditation period. One time, when I was trying to concentrate
on the breath, I kept being distracted by a loud air conditioner. After
a while, I gave up and switched to that sound—and gradually
became pretty absorbed in it.

## Managing the Desire for Stimulation

The following methods increase the stimulation of meditation, and they’re
particularly useful for people with a spirited temperament. The art is to use
them only as long as they’re needed to steady the mind, not as an escape
from the discipline of meditation.

The brain intensifies attention in response to novelty. So notice the
individual qualities of each breath. Draw in new information by
paying attention to details, such as the sensations at different spots
on the upper lip.
Focus on multiple sensations in a large area of your body, such as
the chest. Or notice how breathing creates sensations all over your
body, such as subtle movements in your hips and head.
Break the breath into small parts so there’s more to notice.
Inhalation, exhalation, and the little pause in between—that’s three
parts right there. Or divide each inhalation and exhalation further.
(You can apply similar methods to walking meditation and other
practices.)
Do walking meditation, which provides more stimulation than
sitting quietly. Or use related practices for meditation, such as yoga
or tai chi.
Open to feelings of sufficiency and contentment. This both increases
stimulation and conveys the message that you are full as you are and
don’t need to reach for anything else.
Since the neutral feeling tone is not stimulating, it prompts the mind
to go scurrying off looking for action. So watch what your mind
does with neutral mind-objects, and increase their stimulation by
softly noting ”neutral.”

## Rapture and Joy

Now let’s explore the next two factors of absorption: rapture and joy.
Positive feelings like these help concentrate attention by causing steadily
hightransmissions of dopamine to the neural substrate of working memory.
As we saw in the previous chapter, the gate to working memory—and thus
to the field of awareness—pops open both when dopamine slumps and
when it spikes. Steadily high dopamine—like from positive feelings—
prevents slumps. Further, when dopamine-releasing neurons are already
near their peak firing rate, it’s hard to get a spike—they’re near their ceiling
and can’t get much higher. Thus, the more enjoyable and intense your
feelings are, the greater the dopamine release—and the more concentrated
your attention.

In other words, whether you are going deep into meditative

contemplation or just trying to keep your eyes open in an afternoon
meeting, happiness can really help. Personally, I have found the
intensification of positive emotions during meditation to be a wonderful
practice: it feels great, it increases concentration, and it nourishes a strong
feeling of well-being throughout the day.

Here are some ways to intensify rapture and joy. Try them first in your

meditation, and then experiment with them in everyday situations.

Notice rapture and joy when they emerge on their own. Open to
them and invite them in.
Think to yourself: _May rapture (bliss) arise. May joy (happiness,_
_contentment, tranquility) arise._ In a relaxed way, intend for rapture
and joy to arise.
Integrate rapture and joy with the sensations of the breath. Let bliss
breathe you, let the breath be tranquil.
Make rapture or joy the new object of your attention, and then
become increasingly absorbed in that state of being.
Joy encompasses happiness, contentment, and tranquility; explore
each one of these. In particular, tranquility is one of the seven
factors of enlightenment in Buddhism, and it also leads to
concentration. This sense of great peace and quiet—like a still,
glassy pond—is really worth knowing and cultivating.
Be mindful of the nuances of rapture, happiness, contentment, and
tranquility. Get a clear sense of each state so you can call it to mind
in the future. Over time, it is natural for a person to be drawn
increasingly away from the intensity of rapture toward the subtler
but more sublime rewards of happiness, contentment, and
tranquility.
Experiment with gently intensifying these states of mind, perhaps in
concert with a subtle quickening of the breath. There is a natural
rhythm in which a state gets stronger for seconds, maybe minutes,
and then settles back down—and then you can intensify it again.
Over the course of your meditation, it often works to move from
rapture to happiness to contentment to tranquility. Then, as the
meditation approaches its end, reverse the journey step by step
rather than hopping straight from tranquility to rapture.


-----

In general, find the sweet spot where you are just active enough
inside your mind to encourage these various states, but you’re not
overdirecting your mind or attached to any particular result.

## Singleness of Mind

Singleness of mind involves the unification of awareness, grounded in a
deepening absorption in the object of attention. Thoughts are minimal and
the mind is very steady. You feel very present, with a growing sense of
equanimity.


This state is probably associated with the high-frequency gamma waves

that are seen in experienced meditators (Lutz et al. 2004). As a person goes
deeper into meditation, there appears to be both a spreading and a
strengthening of gamma wave activity, which presumably underlies the
experience of a growing spaciousness and stability of awareness.

Singleness of mind tends to follow naturally from the other four factors

of concentration. You can also encourage it in several additional ways.
First, as we discussed earlier, whole body awareness stimulates the holistic,
gestalt processing of the right hemisphere, and thus helps unify the mind.
To experience whole body awareness, start by getting a sense of the


-----

breathing as a whole, and then extend that sensing to include the body as
one unified whole; if the experience crumbles, just keep regenerating it
until it’s more stable. Second, give yourself over to the present moment as it
is. Drop the past and the future; for this time, in this meditation, renounce
worrying, planning, or fantasizing. Nurture a continuity of here-and-now
presence. Third, relax the sense of personal self as much as you can (we’ll
explore this further in the next chapter). Too much “I” will just distract and
divide you from the beautiful depth of being that is singleness.

## Concentration Meditation

No matter where you start, you can become better at concentration. It’s like
a muscle: when you use it, it gets stronger. When your mind wanders, as it
inevitably will, try not to be self-critical; simply return to awareness of the
next breath. As the Buddhist teacher Joseph Goldstein says, be relaxed but
not casual. It’s not what happened in the past that matters but what you do
_now_ . You can always reapply your attention to the breath and sustain it. You
can always open to rapture and joy. And you can always tip farther into
singleness of mind.

The Buddha offered a kind of road map for contemplative practice:

steady the mind, quiet it, bring it to singleness, and concentrate it. We’ll use
this as a guide for the following meditation, which draws on the supports
for mindfulness and concentration covered in this chapter and previous
ones. You can also adapt these instructions for other meditations or
mindfulness activities.

## The Meditation

_Find a comfortable posture, one that is both relaxed and alert. Close your_
_eyes or leave them open, gazing a few feet in front of you._

_Be aware of sounds coming and going. Aware of sensations in your body._
_Aware of thoughts and feelings. Notice anything that is particularly_
_distracting; be mindful of this distraction for a while and then see if you can_
_shift your focus to the breath._


-----

_Form an intention for your meditation, perhaps with words or perhaps_
_wordlessly. Imagine being someone very focused, either a person you know_
_or a historical figure like the Buddha._

_Really relax. Take a big inhalation and then exhale fully, feeling the tension_
_leave your body. Be aware of the internal sensations of breathing, cool air_
_coming in and warm air going out, the chest and belly rising and falling._
_Don’t try to control the breath in any way, just let it be what it is. Stay_
_aware of the breath throughout the meditation, using it as a kind of anchor._

_Feel as safe as you can. You’re in a protected setting, strong in yourself,_
_able to relax vigilance and bring attention inward._

_Find some compassion for yourself. Bring to mind other positive feelings as_
_well, including soft ones such as gratitude._

_Sense the benefits of this meditation sinking into you, nurturing and helping_
_you, gently inclining your mind and brain in an ever more wholesome_
_direction._

_All right. For the next five minutes or more, try to stay present with each_
_individual breath from beginning to end. Imagine a little guardian in your_
_mind who is watching your attention and will let you know right away if it_
_starts to wander. Give yourself over to each breath and abandon everything_
_else. Let go of the past, let go of the future, and be present with each breath._

_Find a place where the physical sensations of breathing are prominent, such_
_as the chest or upper lip. At the beginning of each inhalation, apply_
_attention to these sensations. Then sustain attention to them from beginning_
_to end. Be aware of the space between inhalation and exhalation. Then_
_apply attention to the exhalation and sustain attention to it all the way to its_
_end._

_If it helps, count each breath gently in your mind, from one to ten, starting_
_over if you lose track. Or softly note the breath, “In, out.” As concentration_
_deepens, let these words fall away._

_Give yourself over to the breath, renouncing all else during this meditation._
_Know the sensations in each breath. Breathing in, know that you are_
_breathing in. Breathing out, know that you are breathing out._


-----

_All right. Be aware of any feelings of rapture or joy. Open to them and_
_invite them in. May bliss arise. May happiness arise. Shift your attention to_
_them for a while. As you can, intensify feelings of rapture and joy. Perhaps_
_breathe a little faster. If you experience them, allow rushes of bliss to move_
_through your body._

_Let yourself feel very happy, very content, very tranquil. Explore the distinct_
_qualities of rapture, happiness, contentment, and tranquility. Become_
_increasingly absorbed in these states._

_Bring rapture and joy into your breath, deepening your absorption further,_
_really steadying your mind._

_All right. Your mind is getting very quiet. Attention is absorbed mainly in_
_one object, such as the sensations of the breath at the upper lip. Few verbal_
_thoughts come, and they pass quickly. There’s a great tranquility. There’s an_
_awareness of breathing as a whole, all the sensations of the breath unified_
_as a whole. Then an awareness of the body as a whole. Sense the whole_
_body shifting slightly with the breath. You’re not moving for or against_
_anything passing through the mind. If something seems about to disturb the_
_peace, let if pass and relax into the quiet._

_All right. Your mind is coming into singleness. There is awareness of the_
_body as a whole, of experience as a whole. Few thoughts, maybe none at_
_all. A sense of boundaries and barriers falling away within your mind. No_
_resistance to anything. Utterly letting go. Feel a growing unification_
_spreading and strengthening in your mind. May singleness arise._

_Allow states of mind to occur that may be unfamiliar in their fullness and_
_profundity. Let go of any thoughts. Settle deeper into the breath, becoming_
_one with the breath. Absorption in the breath is increasingly effortless._
_Nothing to reach for, nothing to be. Allow insight to arise, seeing into_
_experience and the mind and the world. Little remnants of craving fall_
_away. You’re peaceful and free._

_All right. When you like, gradually bring the meditation to an end. Gently_
_return from wherever you are to tranquility, then contentment, then_
_happiness, then a taste of rapture, then a more everyday state of mind. Take_
_your time. Be gentle with yourself._


-----

_May this peacefulness and steadiness of mind sink into your being,_
_becoming a part of you. May it nurture you and all those around you._

## chapter 12: Key Points

Mindfulness leads to wisdom, and the best way to increase
mindfulness is meditation.
Besides its benefits for productivity, learning, and health, meditation
concentrates the mind for contemplative practice; concentration
supports deep and liberating insight into both the causes of suffering
and the causes of great happiness and peace.
In Buddhism, there are five traditional factors that steady the mind:
applied attention, sustained attention, rapture, joy, and singleness of
mind. We explored many ways to strengthen their neural substrates.
We addressed difficulties with applied and sustained attention in
terms of the three aspects of attention: holding onto its object,
filtering out distractions, and managing the desire for stimulation.
Rapture and joy help concentrate attention by causing steadily high
transmissions of dopamine; these keep the gate to working memory
shut so you can become increasingly absorbed with what’s inside.
Singleness of mind is probably supported by fast gamma wave
synchronization of large areas of the brain. You can encourage this
state through the other four factors of concentration, plus whole
body awareness, surrendering to the moment, and relaxing the sense
of self.

## chapter 13

# Relaxing the Self

_To study the Way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self._

_To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things._

—Dogen

Now we come to perhaps the single greatest source of suffering—and
therefore to what it’s most important to be wise about: the apparent self.

Look into your own experience. When you take things personally—or

hunger for approval—what happens? You suffer. When you identify with
something as “me” or try to possess something as “mine,” you set yourself
up for suffering, since all things are frail and will inevitably pass away.
When you stand apart from other people and the world as “I,” you feel
separate and vulnerable—and suffer.

On the other hand, when you relax the subtle sense of contraction at the

very nub of “me”—when you’re immersed in the flow of life rather than
standing apart from it, when ego and egotism fade to the background—then
you feel more peaceful and fulfilled. You may have experienced this under
a starry night sky, at the edge of the sea, or when your child was born.
Paradoxically, the less your “I” is here, the happier you are. Or, as both
Buddhist monks and inmates on death row sometimes say: “No self, no
problem.”

At some point in life, we all ask the same question: _Who am I?_ And no

one really knows the answer. The self is a slippery subject—especially
when it’s the subject that is regarding itself as an object! So let’s begin by
grounding this airy topic with an experiential activity—taking the body for
a walk. Then we’ll investigate the nature of the self in your brain. Last,
we’ll explore methods for relaxing and releasing “self-ing” in order to feel
more confident, peaceful, and joined with all things. (For more on this
profound matter, which reaches beyond the scope of a single chapter, see


-----

_Living Dhamma_ by Ajahn Chah, _The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing_
_Who You Are_ by Alan Watts, _I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta_
_Maharaj_ , or _The Spiritual Teaching of Ramana Maharshi_ .)

## Taking the Body for a Walk

Try to do this exercise with as little sense of “I” as possible. If you become
uncomfortable in any way, focus your attention on basic physical
sensations, such as in your feet or hands.

Exercise

_Relax. Be aware of your body breathing._

_Establish the intention to let go of the self as much as you can, and see what_
_that’s like._

_Be aware of breathing. Be breathing. There’s nothing else to do. No need_
_for the self to do anything._

_Feel as safe as possible. Relax any sense of threat or aversion. No need to_
_mobilize the self for protection._

_Feel peacefulness rising and falling with each breath. No need for self to_
_grasp at any pleasure._

_Keep letting go. Let go with every exhalation. Let go of the self with every_
_exhalation._

_Relax any control of breathing. Let the body manage breathing, just like it_
_does during sleep._

_Breathing continues. Awareness continues. There is spacious awareness_
_with little sense of self. Peaceful and pleasant, no need for self. Awareness_
_and the world going on, doing all right without a self._

_Slowly move the gaze around. Sights need no self to receive them._

_Explore small movements, without a self directing them. A finger moves a_
_little, weight shifts in the chair. Intentions prompt those movements, but no_
_“I” needs to guide them._


-----

_Gently stand up without self guiding the standing. There is awareness of_
_standing here, but does there need to be a self here?_

_Move a little while standing, perceptions and movements happening without_
_needing an owner or director of those experiences._

_Then explore walking about, slowly or quickly. Without needing self to do_
_so. Perceptions and movements occurring without anyone identifying with_
_those experiences. Take a few minutes for this._

_After a while, sit down again. Rest in breathing, simply present, being_
_aware. Thoughts about the self, or thoughts from the perspective of “I,” are_
_just contents of awareness like any other, not special in any way._

_Relax and breathe. Sensations and feelings are just contents of awareness_
_arising and dispersing. Self, too, arises and disperses in awareness, not a_
_problem at all. Just self coming and going as it may. No problem at all._

_Relax and breathe. See what’s present when self is absent._

_Relax and breathe. No problem at all._

## Reflections

It may be a little hard to move back into the realm of verbal thought. While
reading here, explore the sense of words comprehended without a self doing
the comprehending. Notice that the mind can perform its functions just fine
without a self in charge.

Looking back on the exercise:

What was the experience of self, “I,” or “mine?” What does self feel
like? Is it a pleasant or unpleasant experience? Is there a sense of
contraction when self increases?
Is it possible to do many mental and physical activities without
much sense of self?
Was the self always the same, or did different aspects come to the
forefront at different times? Did the intensity of the self change, too
—was the sense of “I” sometimes strong and sometimes subtle?


-----

What led the self to change? What effects did fear or anger have, or
other thoughts of threat? What effects did desire have, or other
thoughts of opportunity? What effects did other people either
encountered or imagined have? Does the self exist independently, or
does it arise and change depending on causes and conditions?

## Self in Your Brain

The experiences of self you just had—that it has many aspects, is just part
of the whole person, is continually changing, and varies according to
conditions—depend on the physical substrates of self in your brain.
Thoughts, feelings, images, and so on exist as patterns of information
represented by patterns of neural structure and activity. In the same way, the
various aspects of the apparent self—and the intimate and powerful
experience of _being_ a self—exist as patterns in the mind and brain. The
question is not whether those patterns exist. The key questions are: What is
their _nature_ ? And does that which those patterns seem to stand for—an “I”
who is the unified, ongoing owner of experiences and agent of actions—
truly exist? Or is self like a unicorn, a mythical being whose representations
exist but who is actually imaginary?

**Self Has Many Aspects**

The many aspects of self are based on structures and processes spread

throughout the brain and nervous system, and embedded in the body’s
interactions with the world. Researchers categorize those aspects of self,
and their neural underpinnings, in a variety of ways. For example, the
_reflective self_ (“I am solving a problem”) likely arises mainly in neural
connections among the anterior cingulate cortex, upper-outer prefrontal
cortex (PFC), and hippocampus; the _emotional self_ (“I am upset”) emerges
from the amygdala, hypothalamus, _striatum_ (part of the basal ganglia), and
upper brain stem (Lewis and Todd 2007). Different parts of your brain
recognize your face in group photos, know about your personality,
experience personal responsibility, and look at situations from your
perspective rather than someone else’s (Gillihan and Farah 2005).


-----

The _autobiographical self_ (D’Amasio 2000) incorporates the reflective

self and some of the emotional self, and it provides the sense of “I” having
a unique past and future. The _core_ _self_ involves an underlying and largely
nonverbal feeling of “I” that has little sense of the past or the future. If the
PFC—which provides most of the neural substrate of the autobiographical
self—were to be damaged, the core self would remain, though with little
sense of continuity with the past or future. On the other hand, if the
subcortical and brain stem structures which the core self relies upon were
damaged, then both the core and autobiographical selves would disappear,
which suggests that the core self is the neural and mental foundation of the
autobiographical self (D’Amasio 2000). When your mind is very quiet, the
autobiographical self seems largely absent, which presumably corresponds
to a relative deactivation of its neural substrate. Meditations that still the
mind, such as the concentration practices we explored in the previous
chapter, improve conscious control over that deactivation process.

The _self-as-object_ arises when you deliberately think about yourself

—“Would I rather eat Chinese or Italian food tonight? How come I’m so
indecisive?”—or when associations to yourself spontaneously arise in
awareness. These representations of “me” are contents within a narrative
that strings together momentary snapshots of self into a kind of movie of a
seemingly coherent self over time (Gallagher 2000). Narrative selfreferencing relies on midline cortical structures (Farb et al. 2007), as well as
on the junction of the temporal and parietal lobes, and on the back end of
the temporal lobe (Legrand and Ruby 2009). These regions of your brain
perform numerous other functions, too (e.g., thinking about other people,
making evaluations), so they cannot be said to be specifically related to the
self (Legrand and Ruby 2009). Representations of the self flit through them
amidst all sorts of other mental contents, jostling together like different
twigs and leaves in a stream, apparently without any neurologically special
status.

More fundamentally, the _self-as-subject_ is the elemental sense of being

an experiencer of experiences. Awareness has an inherent subjectivity, a
localization to a particular perspective (e.g., to my body, not yours). That
localization is grounded in the body’s engagement with the world. For
example, when you turn your head to scan a room, what you see is
specifically related to your own movements. The brain indexes across
innumerable experiences to find the common feature: the experiencing of


-----

them in one particular body. In effect, subjectivity arises from the inherent
distinction between _this_ body and _that_ world; in the broadest sense,
subjectivity is generated not only in the brain but in the ongoing
interactions the body has with the world (Thompson 2007).

Then the brain indexes across moments of subjectivity to create an

apparent subject who– over the course of development, from infancy to
adulthood– is elaborated and layered through the maturation of the brain,
notably regions of the prefrontal cortex (Zelazo, Gao, and Todd 2007). But
there is no subject _inherent_ in subjectivity; in advanced meditation
practices, one finds a bare awareness without a subject (Amaro 2003).
Awareness requires subjectivity, but it does not require a subject.

In sum, from a neurological standpoint, the everyday feeling of being a

unified self is an utter illusion: the apparently coherent and solid “I” is
actually built from many subsystems and sub-subsystems over the course of
development, with no fixed center, and the fundamental sense that there is a
subject of experience is fabricated from myriad, disparate moments of
subjectivity.

**Self Is Just One Part of a Person**

A _person_ is a human body-mind as a whole, an autonomous and dynamic

system that arises in dependence upon human culture and the natural world
(Mackenzie 2009). You’re a person and I’m a person. Persons have
histories, values, and plans. They are morally culpable and reap the
consequences of what they sow. The person goes on being as long as the
body is alive and the brain is reasonably intact. But as we’ve seen, selfrelated mental contents have no special neurological status and are just part
of the ongoing stream of mental activity. Whatever aspect of self that is
momentarily active engages only a small fraction of the brain’s many
networks (Gusnard et al 2001; Legrand and Ruby 2009). Even those aspects
of self that are stored in explicit and implicit memory take up only a portion
of the brain’s storehouse of information about the world, perceptual
processing, skilled action, and more. The self is just one part of the whole
person.

Further, most aspects of a person can buzz merrily along without an “I”

directing them. For example, most of your thoughts arise without any


-----

deliberate creation. We all routinely engage in many mental and physical
activities without “I” making them happen. In fact, often the less self the
better, since that improves many kinds of task performance and emotional
functioning (Koch and Tsuchiya 2006; Leary, Adams, and Tate 2006). Even
when it seems like the self has made a conscious decision, that choice is
often the result of unconscious factors (Galdi, Arcuri, and Gawronksi 2008;
Libet 1999).

In particular, awareness does not need a self to operate. Aspects of self

arise and disperse within awareness, but awareness persists as a field of
consciousness independent of the vicissitudes of self. To experience this, be
mindful of the first second or two of hearing or seeing something new. At
first there is often just the barest perception crystallizing in awareness, with
no sense of a being, an “I” who is perceiving it; then it’s possible to observe
a growing sense of self linked to the perception, particularly if it is
personally significant. But it is directly apparent that _awareness can do its_
_job without a subject._ We routinely presume that there is a subject of
consciousness because consciousness entails subjectivity, as we saw above,
and the brain indexes across moments of subjectivity to find an apparent
subject. But subjectivity is just a way to structure experience; it’s not an
entity, a ghostly being looking out through your eyes. In fact, observing
your own experience shows that the self—the apparent subject—often
comes in after the fact. In many ways, the self is like someone running
behind a parade that is already well under way, continually calling out: “See
what I created!”

**Self Keeps Changing**

As different parts of self come forward and then give way to other parts,

so do the momentary neural assemblies that enable them. If the energy
flows of these assemblies could be seen as a play of light, an extraordinary
show would move endlessly about your head. In the brain, _every_
_manifestation of self is impermanent._ The self is continually constructed,
deconstructed, and constructed again.

The self seems coherent and continuous because of how the brain forms

conscious experience: imagine a thousand photographs overlaying each
other, each one taking a few seconds to develop into a clear picture and then


-----

fade out. This composite construction of experience creates the illusion of
integration and continuity, much like twenty-two static frames per second
create the semblance of motion in a movie. Consequently, we experience
“now” not as a thin sliver of time in which each snapshot of experience
appears sharply and ends abruptly, but as a moving interval roughly 1– 3
seconds long that blurs and fades at each end (Lutz et al. 2002; Thompson
2007).

It is not so much that we have a self, it’s that we do self-ing. As

Buckminster Fuller famously said, “I seem to be a verb.”

**Self Depends on Conditions**

At any moment, the parts of self that are present depend on many factors,

including genetic heritage, personal history, temperament, and situations. In
particular, self depends a lot on the feeling tone of experience. When the
feeling tone is neutral, the self tends to fade into the background. But as
soon as something distinctly pleasant or unpleasant appears—for example,
an interesting email or a physical pain—the self quickly mobilizes along the
processing cascade that moves from feeling tone to craving, and from
craving to clinging. The self organizes around strong desires. Which comes
first: Do “I” form a desire? Or does desire form an “I?”

The self also depends greatly on social context. Walk along casually:

often not much sense of self. But bump into an old acquaintance, and within
seconds many parts of the self come online, such as memories of shared
experiences—or wondering how you look.

Self never comes forward on its own. For starters, it developed over

several million years, shaped by the twists and turns of evolution (Leary &
Buttermore 2003). Then at any moment today, it arises through neural
activities that depend on other bodily systems, and those systems depend on
a network of supporting factors ranging from grocery stores to the
seemingly arbitrary but remarkably provident physical constants of this
universe, which enable the conditions for life such as stars, planets, and
water. _The self has no inherent, unconditional, absolute existence_ apart
from the network of causes it arises from, in, and as (MacKenzie 2009).


-----

**Self Is Like a Unicorn**

Self-related representations abound in the mind and thus in the brain.

Those patterns of information and neural activity are certainly real. But that
which they point to, explicitly or implicitly– a unified, enduring,
independent “I” who is the essential owner of experiences and agent of
actions– just doesn’t exist. In the brain, self-related activities are distributed
and compounded, not unified; they are variable and transient, not enduring;
and they are dependent on changing conditions, including the interactions
the body has with the world. Just because we have a sense of self does not
mean that we are a self. The brain strings together heterogenous moments
of self-ing and subjectivity into an illusion of homogenous coherence and
continuity. The self is truly a fictional character. Sometimes it’s useful to act
as if it’s real, as we’ll see below. Play the role of the self when you need to.
But try to keep remembering that who you are as a person– dynamically
intertwined with the world– is more alive, interesting, capable, and
remarkable than any self.

## (An Apparent) Self Has Its Uses

An apparent self is good for some things. It is a convenient way to
distinguish one person from another. It brings a sense of continuity to life’s
kaleidoscope of experiences, linked to each other by appearing to happen to
a particular “me.” It adds verve and commitment to relationships—“I love
you” is a much more powerful statement than “There is love arising here.”

A sense of self is present at birth in nascent form (Stern 2000), and

children normally develop substantial self structures by age five; if they
don’t, their relationships are very impaired. Self-related processes are wired
into the brain for good reasons. They helped our ancestors succeed in
increasingly social hunter-gatherer bands in which interpersonal dynamics
played a strong role in survival; reading the self in others and expressing
one’s own self skillfully were very useful in forming alliances, mating, and
keeping children alive to pass on one’s genes. The evolution of
relationships fostered the evolution of self and vice versa; the benefits of
self have thus been a factor in the evolution of the brain. Self has been


-----

stitched into human DNA by reproductive advantages slowly accumulating
across a hundred thousand generations.

The point here isn’t to defend or justify the self. But neither should we

demean or suppress it. Just don’t make self special—it’s simply an arising
mental pattern that’s not categorically different from or better than any
other mind-object. When you use the methods that follow, you’re not
resisting the self or making it a problem. You’re just seeing through it and
encouraging it to relax, to dissipate like morning fog clearing under the sun.
And what’s left behind? Open-hearted spaciousness, wisdom, values and
virtues, and a soft sweet joy.

## Release Identification

One way the self grows is by equating itself to things—by identifying with
them. Unfortunately, when you identify with something, you make its fate
your own—and yet, everything in this world ultimately ends. So be mindful
of how you identify with positions, objects, and people. A traditional
inquiry is to ask questions like these: _Am I this hand? Am I this belief? Am I_
_this sense of “I”? Am I this awareness?_ Perhaps follow the question with an
explicit answer, such as: _No, I am not this hand._

Be especially watchful about identifying with the executive functions

(e.g., monitoring, planning, choosing). Notice how often your brain just as
successfully makes plans and choices _without_ much “I” involved, such as
while driving to work. Be mindful as well about identifying with
awareness; allow awareness to arise without needing to identify with or
direct it.

Regard “I,” “me,” “mine,” and other forms of self as just more mind-

objects—thoughts like any other. Remind yourself: _I am not thoughts. I am_
_not these thoughts of “I.”_ Don’t identify with the self! Don’t use self words
(“I,” “me,” “myself,” and “mine”) any more than necessary. Try to get
through a specific period of time, such as an hour at work, without using
them at all.

Let experiences flow through awareness without identifying with them. If

this stance were verbalized, it would sound something like this: _Seeing is_


-----

_happening. There is sensation. Thoughts arise. A sense of self emerges._
Move, plan, feel, and talk with as little presumption of self as possible.

Extend this mindfulness to the mini-movies playing in the simulator of

your mind. Notice how a presumption of self is embedded in most of these
movies, even when the self is not an overt character. This embedding
reinforces the self as neurons fire and wire together in your simulations.
Instead, cultivate a general attitude, also reaching into the mini-movies, that
events can be perceived from the perspective of a particular body-mind
without there needing to be an “I” to do the perceiving.

## Generosity

Self also grows through possessiveness. Self is like a knotted fist: when you
open the hand to give, there’s no more fist—no more self.

You can give so much in this life, and that offers you many opportunities

to release the self. For example, you can give time, helpfulness, donations,
restraint, patience, noncontention, and forgiveness. Any path of service—
including raising a family, caring for others, and many kinds of work—
incorporates generosity.

Envy—and its close cousin, jealousy—is a major impediment to

generosity. So notice the suffering in envy, how it is an affliction upon _you_ .
Envy actually activates some of the same neural networks involved with
physical pain (Takahashi et al. 2009). In a compassionate and kind way,
remind yourself that you will be all right even if other people have fame,
money, or a great partner—and you don’t. To free yourself from the
clutches of envy, send compassion and loving-kindness to people you envy.
Once, on a meditation retreat, I was thinking enviously about some people
and found a surprising peace in this wish toward them: _May you have all_
_the success that I lack._

Also, observe perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and other mind-objects,

and inquire: _Does this have an owner?_ Then observe the truth of things:
_This has no owner._ It’s fruitless to try to possess the mind; no one owns it.

## Healthy Humility


-----

Perhaps most of all, self grows through self-importance; its antidote is
healthy humility. Being humble means being natural and unassuming, _not_
being a doormat, ashamed, or inferior. It just means you’re not setting your
self above others. Humility feels peaceful. You don’t have to work at
impressing people, and no one is at odds with you for being pretentious or
judgmental.

**Be Good to Yourself**

Paradoxically, it supports humility to take good care of yourself, since

self networks in your brain activate when you feel threatened or
unsupported. To reduce this activation, make sure your fundamental needs
are well cared for. For example, we all need to feel cherished. Empathy,
praise, and love from others—especially in childhood—are internalized in
neural networks that support feelings of confidence and worth. But if you
receive these in short supply over the years, you’re likely to end up with a
hole in your heart.

The self gets very busy around that hole! Trying to put a lid on the hole

through cockiness or to get a momentary “fix” through clinginess. Besides
being annoying to others—leading you to receive less empathy, praise, and
love than ever—these strategies are pointless, since they don’t address the
fundamental issue.

Instead, fill the hole in your heart by taking in the good (see chapter 4),

one brick at a time. When I was younger, the hole in my heart looked about
as big as the excavation for a skyscraper. When I realized that it should and
_could_ get filled, I deliberately looked for evidence of my worth, such as the
love and respect of others, and my good qualities and accomplishments.
Then I’d take a few seconds to soak in the experience. After several weeks
and lots of bricks, I started to feel different; within a few months, there was
a significantly greater sense of personal worth. Now, many years and
thousands of bricks later, that hole in my heart is pretty full.

No matter how big your own hole is, each day hands you at least a few

bricks for it. Pay attention to good things about yourself and the caring and
acknowledgement of others—and then take them in. No single brick will
eliminate that hole. But if you keep at it, day by day, brick by brick, you’ll
truly fill it up.


-----

Like many practices, being good to yourself is a kind of raft to get you

across the river of suffering—to use a metaphor from the Buddha. When
you get to the other side, you’ll no longer need the raft. You’ll have built up
your internal resources to the point that you won’t have to consciously look
for evidence of your worth anymore.

**Relax About What Others Think**

We evolved to care greatly about our reputation, since reputation affected

whether others in the band would help or hurt an individual’s chances of
survival (Bowles 2006). It is wholly human to wish to be respected and
even cherished, and to seek that for yourself. But getting caught up in what
others think is a different matter. As Shantideva said (1999, p.113):

_Why should I be pleased when people praise me?_
_Others there will be who scorn and criticize._
_And why despondent when I’m blamed,_
_Since there’ll be others who think well of me?_
Consider how much time you spend thinking—in even the subtlest way,

in the back of the simulator—about what others think of you. Be mindful of
doing things to get admiration and praise. Try to focus instead on just doing
the best you can. Think about virtue, benevolence, and wisdom: if you
sincerely keep trying to come from these, that’s about all you can do. And
it’s a lot!

**You Don’t Need to Be Special**

Believing that you need to be special in order to deserve love and support

sets a really high bar that takes much effort and strain to clear—day after
day after day. And it sets you up for self-criticism and feelings of
inadequacy and worthlessness if you don’t get the recognition you crave.
Instead, try wishing yourself well in these ways: _May I be loved without_
_being special. May I contribute without being special._

Consider renouncing specialness—including being important and

admired. Renunciation is the antithesis of clinging, and thus a radical path


-----

to happiness. Say phrases like these in your mind, and notice what they feel
like: _I give up being important. I renounce seeking approval._ Feel the peace
in this surrender.

Love the _person_ you are, much as you would care about any person dear

to you. But don’t love the _self_ or any other mere mind-object.

## Joined with the World

The sense of self grows when you separate from the world. Therefore,
deepening the sense of connection with the world will reduce the sense of
self.

To live, to have a metabolism, your body must be joined with the world

through continuing exchanges of energy and matter. Similarly, your brain
isn’t fundamentally separate from the rest of the body that feeds and
protects it. Therefore, in a deep sense your brain is joined with the world
(Thompson and Varela 2001). And as we’ve seen many times, the mind and
the brain form an integrated system. Consequently, your mind and the world
are intimately joined together.

You can help this recognition deepen in a variety of ways:

Reflect on the flows of food, water, and sunlight that sustain your
body. See yourself as an animal like any other in your dependence
on the natural world. Spend time in nature.
Pay attention to the aspect of _space_ in your environments, such as
the empty volume of air in your living room, or the space through
which cars move on your way to work. Doing this naturally draws
awareness to things as a whole.
Think bigger and wider. For example, when you buy gasoline,
consider the great network of causes that help produce the apparent
self—driving its car, perhaps feeling stressed or preoccupied—
including the gas station, global economics, and ultimately, ancient
plankton and algae crushed under the earth into oil. See how those
causes depend on an even vaster network that includes the solar
system, our galaxy, other galaxies, and the physical processes of the
material realm. Try to feel the living truth that you arise and abide in
dependence upon the whole universe. The Milky Way is here


-----

because of the local group of galaxies; the sun is here because of the
Milky Way; and you’re here because of the sun—so in some ways
you’re here because of galaxies millions of light years away.
If you can, go all the way out to the ultimate frame: the allness, the
totality that is everything. For example, the world you see at hand,
including your body and mind within it, is always just one whole
thing. At any moment, you can notice this one allness. Its parts
change, endlessly. They unravel, decay, and disperse, every single
one of them. Therefore, no part can ever be a reliable, enduring
source of true happiness—including the self. But the allness as
allness never changes. The whole remains reliably whole. The
whole never clings and suffers. Ignorance contracts from the totality
into the self. Wisdom reverses that process, emptying the self out
into allness.

It’s a wonderful paradox that as individual things—such as the self—feel

increasingly groundless and unreliable, the totality of everything feels
increasingly safe and comforting. As the sense of groundlessness grows,
each apparently individual thing seems a bit like a cloud that you’ll fall
through if you try to stand on it. At first this is pretty unnerving. But then
you realize that the sky itself—the totality—is holding you up. You are
walking on the sky _because you’re sky._ It has always been that way. You
and every one else have been sky all along.

## Joined with Life

One time a friend of mine went on a meditation retreat in a forest monastery
in Burma. He took vows, including not to intentionally kill any living being.
After a couple of weeks, his meditation was not going very well. He also
began to wonder about the latrine near his hut. It was a pit toilet, and after
using it, he was supposed to clean the area around the hole with water, but
there were usually ants nearby which were washed away. He asked the
abbot if this was all right. “No,” the abbot said simply, “that’s not your
vow.” My friend took the abbot’s comment seriously, and started cleaning
the toilet much more carefully. And, perhaps not coincidentally, his
meditation deepened dramatically.


-----

How often do we place our convenience ahead of the life of another

being, even an ant on a toilet? It’s not deliberately cruel, but it is selfcentered. Look the creature in the eye—the mosquito, the mouse—and
know that it wants to live, just like you do. How would it feel to be killed
for someone’s _convenience_ ?

If you want, take on the practice of never killing for your own

convenience. This will draw you into feeling more kinship with all life, you
as a creature in harmony with other beings. You’ll be treating the world as
an extension of yourself: not harming yourself entails not harming the
world.

Similarly, kindness to the world is kindness to yourself. As the self starts

to relax and fall away, you can really wonder how to live. Once on a retreat,
I experienced such a strong sense of everything as a whole that I began to
despair at the utter unimportance of my tiny part of it. My life could not
possibly matter. After hardly sleeping, I sat outside the dining hall before
breakfast, near a little creek, with a doe and her fawn grazing under the
trees close by. I began to feel very deeply that each living thing has its
nature and its place in the whole. The doe licked her fawn, nuzzling and
nibbling it. She clearly belonged where she was, eventually to die and
disperse but meanwhile thriving and contributing in her own way. Insects
and birds rustled in the fallen leaves as well: all moving about, each one
creating benefits for the whole in some way.

Just as each of those animals had its place and its contributions, I had my

own. Not one of us was important. But it was all right to be in my place and
thrive there. It was all right to relax and be the whole. To be the whole
expressed as a part, to be a part expressing the whole.

Sometime later a gray squirrel and I watched each other from just a few

feet apart. It was natural to wish that squirrel well, that it find acorns and
dodge owls. (And, in the complexity of the forest, to wish the owl well too,
that it find a squirrel to ease its hunger.) We looked at each other for a
strangely long time, and I truly wished the best for that squirrel. Then
another thing came clear: I was an organism, too, just like the squirrel. It
was all right to wish myself well just like any other living being.

It is all right to wish yourself well, just like wishing the best for any

living being. It is all right to do well according to your nature, with a human


-----

brain, going as far as you can in this life down the path of happiness, love,
and wisdom.

What remains when self disperses, even temporarily? The wholehearted

movement to contribute, and the wish to thrive and prosper as one human
animal among six billion. To be healthy and strong and live many more
years. To be caring and kind. To awaken, abiding as radiant, spacious,
loving consciousness. To feel protected and supported. To be happy and
comfortable, serene and fulfilled. To live and love in peace.

## chapter 13: Key Points

It’s ironic and poignant that the “I” makes you suffer in many ways.
When you take things personally, identify with or try to possess
things that inevitably end, or separate yourself from all things, you
suffer. But when you relax the sense of self and flow with life, you
feel happy and satisfied.
When you take the body for a walk—or do just about anything—
without much sense of self, you discover some interesting things:
the self usually feels a little contracted and tense, it is often
unnecessary, and it continually changes. The self gets especially
activated in response to opportunities and threats; desires often form
an “I” before an “I” forms desires.
Thoughts, feelings, images, and such exist as patterns of information
based on patterns of neural structure and activity. In the same way,
representations of the self and the sense of being a self exist as
patterns in the mind and brain. The question is not whether those
patterns exist. The key questions are: What is their _nature_ ? And
does that which they point to—a unified, ongoing owner of
experiences and agent of actions—truly exist?
The many aspects of self are based on numerous neural networks.
These networks perform many functions unrelated to the self, and
representations of self within them don’t appear to have any
neurologically special status.
The self is just part of the person. Most thoughts, plans, and actions
don’t need a self to direct them. Self-related neural networks


-----

comprise only a small part of the brain, and an even smaller part of
the nervous system.
The self keeps changing; in the brain, every manifestation of the self
is impermanent. Just as the individual frames in a movie create the
illusion of motion, the overlapping neural assemblies that flow
together and then disperse create the illusion of a coherent and
continuous self.
The self arises and changes depending on various conditions,
notably pleasant and unpleasant feeling tones. It also depends on
relationships—including with the wider world. The most
fundamental basis for the sense of “I”—the subjectivity inherent in
awareness—emerges in the relationship between the body and the
world. The self has no independent existence whatsoever.
Self-related mental activity, including the sense of being the subject
of experience, refers to a unified, enduring, independent “I” who is
the essential owner of experiences and agent of actions—but such a
one does not exist. The self is a collection of real representations of
an unreal being—like a story about a unicorn.
The apparent self is useful for relationships and for a healthy sense
of psychological coherence over time. Humans have a sense of self
because it served vital survival functions during our evolution. It is
pointless to be averse to the self, since aversion intensifies the self.
The point is to see through the self and let it relax and disperse.
The self grows through identification, possession, pride, and
separation from the world and life. We explored many ways to
disengage from these and, instead, center increasingly in
openhearted spaciousness, goodwill toward one’s own thriving, and
contented peaceful relationships with other beings.

## Appendix

# Nutritional
 Neurochemistry

J AN H ANSON , L.A C .

The previous chapters have explored how to influence the brain through
mental interventions. This appendix will summarize ways to support brain
function through the _physical_ intervention of skillful nutrition. Of course,
none of these suggestions are a substitute for professional care, nor are they
aimed at treating any medical condition.

As an acupuncturist who has focused on clinical nutrition for many years

—and needed to apply some of its lessons to herself!—I’ve repeatedly seen
that small, thoughtful, sensible changes in what you put into your mouth
each day can gradually produce significant benefits. And sometimes these
steps—such as taking nutrients you’ve needed for a long time—can lead to
rapid improvements in your well-being.

## Diet Basics

Help your brain by eating well every day, minimizing your sugar intake,
and avoiding food allergens.

**Eat Well Every Day**

Take in a wide variety of rich nutrients. More than anything, this means

eating lots of protein and vegetables. Eat protein at every meal; aim for a
portion roughly the size of your palm. Eat at least three cups of vegetables a
day—more is better! Ideally, half of your plate at each meal will be covered
by vegetables of all kinds and colors. Fruits also provide important
nutrition; berries in particular are known to be good for your brain (Galli et
al. 2006; Joseph et al. 2003).


-----

**Minimize Sugar**

Keep your sugar under control. High blood sugar wears on the

hippocampus (Wu et al. 2008). Impaired glucose tolerance—a sign of
eating too much sugar—is linked to relative cognitive impairment in older
adults (Messier and Gagnon 2000). The best way to minimize sugar is to
avoid refined sugar altogether (especially in sugary drinks) as well as foods
made from refined flour (e.g., bread, noodles, cookies).

**Avoid Food Allergens**

Eating foods to which you are sensitive will cause an allergic and

inflammatory reaction throughout your body, not just in your digestive
system. Chronic inflammation, even if relatively mild, is an enemy of the
brain. For example, gluten sensitivities have been linked to a variety of
neurological disorders (Hadjivassiliou, Gunwale, and Davies-Jones 2002;
Hadjivassiliou et al. 1996). Even without a known sensitivity, increased
consumption of milk correlates with an increased risk of Parkinson’s
disease (Park et al. 2005).

The most common food allergens are products made from cow milk,

gluten grains (wheat, oats, rye, barley, spelt, and kamut), and soy. Food
allergies can be formally identified through blood tests done by a medical
lab. Informally, try eliminating foods you suspect may be problematic for a
week or two, and then notice if you feel better, think more clearly, digest
more easily, and have more energy.

## Fundamental Supplements for Your Brain

Vitamins and minerals are cofactors in thousands of metabolic processes.
They support every aspect of your health, including the functioning of your
brain and mind (Kaplan et al. 2007). So it’s important to get enough of
these to take care of all of your needs. Unless you spend a lot of time
acquiring and preparing fresh foods, you probably aren’t getting optimal
quantities of vitamins and minerals through your diet alone. Therefore, it
makes sense to supplement them prudently.


-----

**Take a High Potency Multivitamin/Multimineral Supplement**

A good multivitamin/multimineral supplement is your insurance policy;

it will help you get a wide variety of essential nutrients. While all nutrients
are important, put a special focus on the B vitamins, which are particularly
vital for brain health. Vitamins B-12, B-6, and folic acid all help a
biochemical process called _methylation_ , which plays a crucial role in the
production of many neurotransmitters. When you are deficient in these B
vitamins, your homocysteine (an amino acid) level may become elevated.
Low B vitamins and high homocysteine are risk factors for cognitive
decline and dementia in older people (Clarke et al. 2007; Vogiatzoglou et al.
2008). Low folic acid is also a risk factor for depression; supplementing it
can relieve depressive symptoms (A. Miller 2008).

Your multivitamin supplement should contain 10– 25 times the daily

value of all of the B vitamins, and 800 mcg or more of folic acid (Marz
1999). It should have most minerals at 100 percent or more of the daily
value. To consume these levels, you may need to augment your general
multi with additional supplements.

**Take Omega-3 Fatty Acids**

The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil—docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)

and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)—provide many benefits to your brain;
these include promotion of neuronal growth, mood elevation, and slowing
of dementia (Ma et al. 2007; Puri 2006; Singh 2005; Su et al. 2003). DHA
is the predominant structural fatty acid in the central nervous system, and its
availability is crucial for brain development. EPA is an important antiinflammatory molecule.

Take enough fish oil to consume at least 500 milligrams of DHA daily,

and about the same amount of EPA (Hyman 2009). Look for a high-quality
source—one that is molecularly distilled; most people prefer capsules to
taking fish oil directly.

Or, if you’re a vegetarian, take a full tablespoon of flax seed oil daily

(perhaps in salad dressing, but don’t cook with it). Although flax seed oil
converts into DHA and EPA, in most people this conversion is inefficient


-----

and incomplete. Consequently, add 500 mg of DHA from algae to your flax
seed oil.

**Take Vitamin E as Gamma-Tocopherol**

Vitamin E is the main antioxidant in the cellular membranes within your

brain (Kidd 2005). The most common form of vitamin E consumed through
the diet is gamma-tocopherol, which makes up 70 percent of total vitamin-E
intake.

Unfortunately, nutritional supplements usually contain alpha-tocopherol,

another form of vitamin E. Alpha-tocopherol seems to be less beneficial
than gamma-tocopherol, and it dilutes the gamma-tocopherol you naturally
get from your diet. This may be one reason why studies of vitamin-E
supplementation have produced mixed results. However, one study found
that older people who consumed higher levels of vitamin E—primarily in
the form of gamma-tocopherol—had less risk of developing Alzheimer’s
disease and slower rates of cognitive decline (Morris et al. 2005).

More research is needed, but in the meantime it seems reasonable to take

a supplement of vitamin E that contains a mixture of the tocopherols, with
gamma-tocopherol in the majority. Take a supplement that has about 400 IU
of vitamin E (Marz 1999), at least half of which is gamma-tocopherol
(Hyman 2009).

## Nutritional Support for Neurotransmitters

You can affect the levels of your neurotransmitters through targeted
nutritional interventions. But be careful about it. Start with the smallest
dosage and respect your own nature; individual responses vary
significantly. Try one supplement at a time, making sure you feel good with
the first one before adding another. Discontinue a supplement immediately
if you experience any negative side effects. Don’t use these supplements if
you are taking an antidepressant or other psychotropic medication unless
your doctor tells you otherwise.


-----

**Serotonin**

Serotonin supports mood, digestion, and sleep. It’s made from the amino

acid tryptophan in essentially two steps: tryptophan is converted into 5hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), which is then turned into serotonin.
Nutritional cofactors are required for these conversions, notably iron and
vitamin B-6 (as pyridoxal-5-phosphate or P5P) (Murray et al. 2000).
Therefore, the following nutrients can help with serotonin production; you
can use them in combination, if you wish.

**IRON**

If you feel fatigued or depressed, talk to your physician about the

possibility that your iron level is low. Additionally, many menstruating
women have low iron levels. A blood test is required to know if you’re
anemic; if you are, you can take an iron supplement, and the proper dosage
will depend on your lab results.

**VITAMIN B-6**

Vitamin B-6 is a co-factor in dozens—perhaps hundreds—of important

metabolic processes, including the production of several neurotransmitters
(e.g., serotonin). Take 50 mg of vitamin B-6 (as P5P) on an empty stomach
in the morning.

**5-HYDROXYTRYPTOPHAN AND TRYPTOPHAN**

Take 50– 200 mg of 5-HTP in the morning or 500– 1,500 mg of

tryptophan before bed (Hyman 2009; Marz 1999). If you are primarily
focused on lifting your mood, take 5-HTP in the morning. It is unlikely to
make you sleepy, and it is the most direct route to serotonin. If insomnia is
an issue, start with tryptophan just before bed, since it’s more likely to
enhance your sleep.

**Norepinephrine and Dopamine**


-----

Norepinephrine and dopamine are excitatory neurotransmitters that

support energy, mood, and attention. The process of creating these
neurotransmitters begins with the amino acid L-phenylalanine. This is
converted into L-tyrosine, which gets made into dopamine; in turn,
dopamine is transformed further into norepinephrine (Murray et al. 2000).

As with serotonin, iron and vitamin B-6 (as P5P) are necessary cofactors

for these conversions. Therefore, supplementing these can increase
norepinephrine and dopamine. Because optimizing serotonin before
enhancing dopamine and norepinephrine often feels better than the reverse,
start with the nutrients that build serotonin. Take these for two weeks or so
before considering phenylalanine or tyrosine.

For some people, phenylalanine and tyrosine supplements feel too

stimulating. If you feel nervous or hyper after taking them, stop. To be
cautious, start with a low dose of 500 mg or less, taken on an empty
stomach in the morning. If you like the effects, you can increase the dose up
to 1,500 mg per day (Hyman 2009). Of these two amino acids, tyrosine is
the most direct route to making norepinephrine and dopamine;
consequently, it’s used more often, though some people prefer Lphenylalanine. Either one is fine.

**Acetylcholine**

Acetylcholine supports memory and attention. To build this

neurotransmitter, you need rich sources of choline in your diet, such as egg
yolks (possibly the best source), beef, liver, or dairy fats. Also consider the
following supplements; if you decide to try supplementation, introduce one
supplement at a time. Find the individual supplement or combination
(potentially including all three) that feels best for you.

**PHOSPHATIDYLSERINE**

Phosphatidylserine (PS) is the major acidic phospholipid in the brain, and

a key component of the brain’s cellular membranes. Phospholipids play an
important role in communication between brain cells. PS supports
acetylcholine (Pedata et al. 1985), and seems to aid memory. You can take
100– 300 mg per day (Hyman 2009).


-----

**ACETYL-L-CARNITINE**

Acetyl-L-carnitine seems to help with memory problems and

Alzheimer’s disease, perhaps through its effect on acetylcholine pathways
(Spagnoli et al. 1991). Try 500– 1,000 mg per day on an empty stomach in
the morning (Hyman 2009). If you’re sensitive to stimulating nutrients, you
may want to try this one last.

**HUPERZINE-A**

Extracted from Chinese club moss, huperzine-A slows the metabolic

breakdown of acetylcholine and thus appears to enhance memory and
attention (Cheng, Ren, and Xi 1996; Sun et al. 1999). Try 50– 200 mg per
day (Hyman 2009).

## Change from the Ground Floor On Up

Your brain is made from trillions of molecules, most of which have come
from what you’ve put in your mouth at one time or another. Through
making small changes in your diet and supplements, you can gradually
change the components of your brain, from the molecular ground floor on
up. As the physical substrate of your brain improves, you’re likely to
experience greater physical and mental well-being, and your psychological
and spiritual practices—including the methods described in this book—will
become even more fruitful.
